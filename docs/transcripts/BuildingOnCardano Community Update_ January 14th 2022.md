# BuildingOnCardano Community Update_ January 14th 2022

[00:00:00] So this third iteration of the building on Cordato series, I had the opportunity to catch up with some of the amazing projects that are building on Cardona. Uh, I talked with melt, men's swap or codex Byron network and indigo protocol. Um, we heard updates on their development, their launch plans, uh, and their vision for the future.

[00:00:25] So let's dive in. So, what is your project's mission and how is that mission different from other projects in the same niche in this market? We're building indigo protocol on the same regard of our defy, uh, decentralized application. You know, our mission is to bring exposure to real world assets, uh, on chain, also known as a synthetic asset for.

[00:00:50] Um, we're quite different from other dabs with the ecosystem that are building Texas or lending protocols. Even though we have a blending element to our protocol, uh, with CDPs, uh, in order to open up, uh, a CVP and mates, an asset, but you know, you have Oracles, stable coin, uh, developers, uh, lending protocols, indexes.

[00:01:12] We simply, uh, integrate with. Uh, and have, uh, you know, a really synergistic product with synthetic assets that can be provided on some of these other protocols, uh, by liquidity providers, meld is a decentralized non-custodial protocol that makes it possible for us to lend and borrow crypto and most uniquely Fiat.

[00:01:34] So we are on the Caetano blockchain and make it, we use smart contracts to make it possible for us to take cryptocurrency, lock it up into a smart country. And then be able to borrow against that either borrowing Fiat or borrowing crypto. The unique part is the Fiat side, right? So traditionally you have lots of protocols that are, make it possible for you to borrow crypto to crypto, but not to borrow crypto to Fiat.

[00:01:59] And so this has been the major problem we've been trying to solve, and this is what we're going to be solving in 2022. Uh, the app name is mishap and our co it will be the most community oriented. On Caetano and Lisa, we have a fairly distributed took economics and we have a revenue shadowing wishes.

[00:02:21] Like part of the revenue from the protocol will be distributed to the covenants token holders. And we have decentralized delegation policy. So let me explain what decentralized election policies. Uh, so in Carano, the ADA locked is smack contract can also be delegated to state four, and we will deliver them to small and medium staple that are rotating by Dio, covenant.

[00:02:47] And we aim to have 20% of the ADA to be delegated to fresh for that haven't produced any blog. We hope that this will have decentralized Ms. Top and kind of known at work. In general, we are developing a cross chain exchange protocol called ergot X, which includes AMM and order book functionality. So our company based on a three simple principles, decency decentralization, Uh, open ends in transparency in everything.

[00:03:17] I mean, organizational operational technical aspects and so on. And the third one is, uh, orientation for the user success. Our mission is to end reach regular people through the most secure and easy to use across changes and realized service. We tried to solve fate based on total transparency, uh, increasing, uh, the customer feedback.

[00:03:48] Uh, such a strategy enables us to continuously changing a user's opinions and suggestions fast, uh, and deliver better services. The name of the DOP and the type of a doublet we create is a decentralized exchange. Something that many, many companies and many teams, uh, do the rest and feed. Uh, but we, uh, we had, uh, we had this opportunity to join the Plutus partnership program, uh, in Cardinal, uh, on a trill, uh, this year.

[00:04:22] And since that time, we, uh, uh, we built a lot of staff around Plutus, we've learned Bluetooth. And, uh, since that time also we built, um, uh, decks it's called vital network. Uh, vital network is our team and byte on decks is the decks that we create. And, uh, Additionally to that. Uh, we built a mobile app, which is a self-sovereign HD wallet.

[00:04:49] Uh, so, uh, these two are combined and we want to deliver those to, um, uh, as a full, uh, product. Uh, so other people can, um, can use a mobile wallet as well to, to exchange their, um, assets. And the way that we do it is a pure order book, uh, pattern with, to, uh, to commoditize us. So it's an idea that was, uh, presented by a large, I believe at the beginning and, uh, in his blockbuster and, uh, That we had an idea on some, um, performing boats and, uh, liquidity pools that should be there similar to uni swab, but at the end, listening to, um, to Charles, um, this current nano ecosystem.

[00:05:40] He's delivered to reconfigure something or even built from scratch. So this is what we've done. We decided not to follow the union swap way of liquidity pools, and we design it in general as a liquidity orders that are put into a curve, similar to what is in liquidity pool on union swab. Uh, and we want to deliver the, the exchange that is traders oriented.

[00:06:08] So the, the thing is that we want to put an API there. We want to make traders to deliver the own. Let's say performers. So, uh, matching, uh, bolts, et cetera. So that's our goal. What are the advantages of building on Cardona in particular? Uh, why is your project. On pro bono, but there's a lot of advantages that we saw and decided early on to build on Cardinal.

[00:06:33] I think from my standpoint, as an entrepreneur and consultant in technology space, I've kind of gotten to witness, uh, the infancy of new innovative spaces and see opportunity there. So, um, choosing Cardona was easy from. Uh, standpoint that the whole data ecosystem, uh, was very infant and its existence existence rather than I think it still is, as opposed to say a more saturated, uh, ecosystem, like what you see on Ethereum.

[00:07:05] Also the ecosystem, I, I strongly believe, uh, is second to none. Uh, Very robust, passionate ecosystem and community following. Oh, the whole card a space. Um, I think from a technical perspective, Cody can probably expand on some of those things, um, for the technical advantages though. So Cody feel free. Yeah, absolutely.

[00:07:26] So, you know, from, uh, our user's perspective, you know, they are receiving, uh, lesser gas fees as well as faster transaction. Um, but, you know, from, from a developer perspective, you know, we, we get the beauty of having formal verification written into, uh, very closely to Plutus and, uh, being able to integrate very closely between the off-chain pieces and the on chain pieces using the previous application backend, we chose Cardona.

[00:07:53] We chose it primarily because of the low transaction fees and the high transaction rates. So that was the sort of initial thinking some year ago. But as we were working on it, we realized that while that was valuable, the more valuable component was the decentralization part, the proof of stake, and the way that proof of stake works on the platform.

[00:08:17] And also the fact that it has high, uh, capital efficiency. So the capital efficiency part and the, and the staking have actually proven to be. A much bigger component or a much bigger benefit for us on cardamom. You know, we are, we launched the first ISP in the ISP was a direct result of the way that Cardona was architected.

[00:08:40] Had we done this on another platform or another, another we wouldn't have been able to have done an ISP. Cardona and its architecture have really demonstrated over and above what we had expected and what we had wanted out of a blockchain. One of the main advantage of building on Cardinal is, is by using the model, which has local state and has a pure model that is easier to reason about.

[00:09:09] And we have to, we don't have to worry about things like the boat engine. See, when we designed smart. And kind of know also have a big and have focused on. That's very nice. Uh, I personally really like the high level of in trying to gardener ecosystem, you know, the bloodless language is too hard to learn and has killed as well.

[00:09:31] You know, it's a sort of, uh, technical filter, uh, for some projects and, uh, uh, teams, uh, who is low level of a programming skills. When it comes to security, this allows the ecosystem to be durable. And a more valuable for the end user science. They can be sure of safety of their assets. Another feature I really like in a Cardona and arrogant as well, ecosystem, uh, is eroding some model.

[00:10:04] It allows us as a developers to build composable product. Uh, such a way of development allows us to combine and reuse different pieces of protocols code, uh, in different places. For example, it is possible to create a stable coin based on our current AMM, uh, pool protocol, uh, and vice versa from the. A stable coin.

[00:10:30] If it's implemented tolerating, uh, you can easy, uh, based on these protocol, I mean, stable coin, you can create amen pool or some kind of other protocols. Uh, th do so, what a model brings to us, the advantages of building on the current dyno is essentially at the beginning, it was, uh, learning, uh, cool stuff.

[00:10:57] That was the, the, the, the biggest thing for us. And, uh, we are, uh, we are great grateful for that. And today as we are moving forward and we can see, uh, what for, we can use. No w what we can use it for it, then, uh, we have more and more ideas. So for example, I was an operational guy in a software development agency.

[00:11:18] And after I just resigned from operations, I started my own startup called . And this is a startup for central and Eastern Europe. Within the FinTech. We are integrating, uh, banks with an open banking. So Cardinal right now looks like the best choice. To build a backend for that. Let's say you've got, um, um, uh, Western union or something similar to that where you, uh, from, from one to another hand, you have to do some kind of remittance and you've got a lot of banks in the middle.

[00:11:51] They all get their own, uh, fees from sometimes it's even 50, 60% of that, of the amount that you sent. Having Cardinal in the middle, uh, we could bring, uh, the, the, the, the registry that, uh, have, uh, have no centralized, um, centralized entities, uh, that are puts, you know, their hands on that money. So, uh, I really strongly believe that we could create once we integrate with, uh, banks.

[00:12:23] Then we could use and Cardinal as a registry, similar to the registers that are around the ward to, to, to compare, uh, banking, uh, registries. So it's like, uh, uh, in, in, uh, in Europe we've got Alex here or some or something like that. So, uh, ACH is in the United States as I believe. So. Uh, w w we think about it as a bucket.

[00:12:52] Yeah. To deliver the, the ability for the unbanked to be banked. So how's it going? What stage are you guys at now in the development process? We're well, along with our development, uh, we've been building since may of this year. Uh, our engineers or some of the top food is contributors to date. Um, and we have multiple murders.

[00:13:14] Uh, we have actually completed our initial audit, uh, with external third party from a tweak who sure. You're familiar with out of one of the few, at this point who are capable of audit included. So yeah, we're really excited to be at that stage in terms of the audit, we've released a medium article that covers not only the items that were.

[00:13:36] But also our response or our resolution to those particular items. But at this point, you know, we're, we're really focused on contributing, upstream, um, integrating closely with the Plutus application backend and, uh, working on finalizing our design and spec, you know, we're working on opening up a private Testnet for a closed, uh, PR our partners and, uh, Uh, people close to our protocol within the ecosystem.

[00:14:05] Um, at which point afterwards, we will open up to a public test that, and the main that after, uh, we are hoping to fit a lot of this into Q1 of 2022. And if anything needs to we'll push back to Q2 development is going well. We're making good progress. We'll be launching the protocol on the 31st of Jan. And then we'll be launching lending and borrowing in Q2 and we'll be launching, um, the Fiat side of things in Q3.

[00:14:38] On the security side, we have basically two activities that we're working on. One of them is obviously doing security audits and we're just about to complete our security audit on our smart contracts. But in addition to that, we saw that that the tooling available for doing security auditing was almost nonexistent.

[00:15:00] So we're currently working with twig and a couple of other development teams that are also collaborating and some researchers to build some tooling called hace for doing auditing on the Catano blockchain. So you can go into these smart contracts and you can use our tooling to do security audits. Um, so those tools that we're collaborating to build are also being used against our own smart contracts on our, in our own.

[00:15:29] Which twig is doing for us. The progress has been moving very smooth lately. And as of today, uh, we are official, complete, and we are preparing for the audit. Our efforts have been focused around to building the Cardinal site of the protocol because herbicide is already implemented and working in production.

[00:15:48] We already finished with the smart contracts. Now we're just have, uh, uh, the . At testing and a formal, uh, verification of AMM contracts, uh, Lyft to finish it. Uh, so do you do the effect we've already implemented and lost their member on Agra blockchain? As I said before, which also base, if you don't aware about ergo, it's a blockchain, which is based on Cardona and.

[00:16:16] I had a smart contract, functional functionality, uh, two years ago when it was launched. Uh, so in parallel, we are working on, uh, another analytic services of the, or, uh, protocol, uh, I mean, both networks, Aragon and Cardinal. Uh, to provide users with more information about the current political state so that people can see the broad image and make better decisions, uh, for either providing liquidity or trading.

[00:16:51] And another big challenge for us today is at tokenization of our project, uh, because we didn't, we didn't do it, uh, yet, uh, Designing in accordance with our basic principles and trying to accommodate the interests of all parties. Uh, we're preparing an economics release, uh, in the first quarter. Next year, testing is really important.

[00:17:20] Right now we are participating, uh, a quick check of cubic, um, way of, of, of testing. Also, we do some, some unit tests by ourselves and we are approaching the moment that the community, uh, should get our application and. Uh, we would love to have them joining it, uh, try to find the leaks and, uh, and pointed out, uh, to be honest, all of our work it's, it's an open source.

[00:17:51] We, we deliver everything it's already there on a get hub on Byron Tech's GitHub repository. You've got mobile wallets. You've got, uh, middle middleware, the API APIs and the decks itself. So we are expecting also, it will be awesome to have some guys joining our repository and, and join building it because it's it's for us, for the community.

[00:18:16] After your project arrives on main net, uh, what are the next critical steps in your road? Um, how does your project continue to develop a big focus? And we've already begun? This process actually is interoperability. Um, you know, though we're a, a native Plutus DAP, um, and fully committed to their cardiac ecosystem.

[00:18:38] Uh, we see the value of having indigo accessible too. Um, and, and on other chains, uh, interoperability is a huge focus, I think, for the entire industry, not just siloed ecosystems in silo chains. I mean, we're seeing, uh, bridges and, and EVMS for quite a few. Um, whether it's Salana avalanche being built out actively as they should be.

[00:19:01] Uh, we, we firmly believe that. In a fully robust industry, not just specific, as I said, ecosystems and interoperability is a huge tool to ensure the longevity of our industry. So that's a huge focus of ours as well as innovating, um, within the synthetic assets, uh, product portfolio, bringing new design concepts to the table, new asset concepts.

[00:19:24] So not only are we always looking to find innovative new products that people can find use of on. But also, like I said, a huge shift in focus to interoperability with regards to our post-launch kind of mission. And what we aim to do for the whole ecosystem on Cardona in general is continue to really build out a new, uh, asset product suite, um, and kind of further the liquidity of the whole ecosystem.

[00:19:51] I mean, obviously total value box it's, it's a, it's a key initiative of ours. To still enable liquidity on the it's on the lending providers and really have all of that, uh, tie in very well in order to do that, you know, we have to have agreements and partnerships. Uh, within the ecosystem, the steps going forward are to demonstrate the value that we've actually proposed to the market.

[00:20:16] And the way that that will show itself will first be by launching crypto to crypto lending, then crypto to Fiat lending, uh, which is a huge component. It's a huge milestone, not just in regards to main net and Carano, but in regards to defy as a general sort of whole, in addition to that, we have some other.

[00:20:37] Services and other products that are coming to market that are related to the protocol. One of those services or products is a gold backed reserve currency. Another one is a credit line. So the ability to use a debit card against the collateral that you've put into the smart contract and use that in the real world.

[00:20:57] Um, we also have several partnerships, one of them, or most notably with. Which is a, a Nigerian mobile carrier. And we're going to be launching that about the same time as we'll be launching the Fiat a lending. And that will be getting into the hands of 9 million Nigerians and giving them the same set of tools that we have in the defy space to be able to lend and borrow and do various different, um, you know, financial instruments in that after launch, we will continue to launch mafia.

[00:21:31] More products and the next critical step would be are you farming or liquidity mining? And that would be a step to incentivize and attract liquidity to our necks and distribute governance token. And then we'll start transitioning into a Dao and start decentralizing. Decision-making we've been working on a series of papers to explain some of our positions.

[00:21:56] Uh, I can say that, uh, the plan is. Uh, our project to a different way than we planned before. The main purpose of the pilot is to become a cross chain liquidity kind of booster of, uh, ergo and Cardinal ecosystems. Uh, it includes, uh, rebranding, uh, updated development roadmap, a marketing plan, and, uh, we believe useful.

[00:22:24] Uh, there is a lot of new information we're exciting about to, uh, sharing with the community. And, uh, the next most important step in the architect's development will be the launch of the platform net native stock. And, uh, we have, uh, meticulously worked on talking omics and distribution model to ensure fair distribution, uh, price discovery, and then, uh, areas in the bowl and utility of the talking in the system.

[00:22:50] We've already done most of the work, but. As I said before, I will keep it in secret until we launched, uh, to deal with. Bush B some date to the public. I would say that initially we want to, uh, to cover and to focus on, uh, on the decks, uh, as I said, based, um, approach to the traders. So this, uh, let's say, uh, another types of orders, uh, that, you know, from centralized exchanges, uh, also the mobile wallets, uh, We would love to see it as a first choice of mobile wallet for Cardinal.

[00:23:32] Also, there is an idea and some talks, uh, with, with the guys that are currently doing some, uh, Fiat to cryptocurrency with the credit cards, that would be awesome to have it anonymous. Uh, and, and, and do it both ways buy and sell the crypto. Uh, so that's the first, uh, goals later on, uh, in a bigger picture or we'd love to, to bring some kind of a bridge between Cardona and other platforms, especially.

[00:24:05] Uh, you take solves once where let's say a dash.org, uh, this, this, these guys are awesome. Uh, and I, I strongly believe the connection between those two, uh, would be profitable for the community for both communities who knows maybe, maybe later, uh, some, some kind of. You know, like once we deliver the application, the platform that has the anchor points that anyone can use, uh, maybe someone will build something interesting on our platform.

[00:24:34] So it's not going to be only the decentralized exchange. At some point it might be a platform. Uh, the centralized applications working on our model. How do you see your projects? Niche continuing to develop, uh, on car Dano and in the wider industry and the longterm, and what problems do you feel that your project is uniquely able to.

[00:24:58] Synthetic assets is a kind of a newer within the defined ecosystem, uh, in the last several years. But I think one of the very exciting things is the possibility to include these different types of assets, whether it be, you know, uh, commodity stocks, digital assets, or even other wider unrecognized assets.

[00:25:19] Uh, and being able to have that price action. Um, and so, you know, there are going to be products that are developed based off this synthetic asset idea that. Um, our, even ourselves going to try and develop, um, you know, we we've talked about it in the going Sonics portfolio, which is really a unique products, uh, are really unique, uh, assets, um, in the synthetic asset realm.

[00:25:45] Um, but you know, in terms of Cardona, w w you know, what we kinda see developing is, uh, Banking the unbanked and you know, that really synergizes with both Indigo's vision and Cardona's vision, you know, being able to give, you know, people in Africa and, uh, third world countries access to assets that they maybe did not have access to easily.

[00:26:09] So that is a very exciting thing for synthetic assets, especially on Cardo. We're excited as well about the cabana. Not only within the cardiac snow, uh, ecosystem, whether it's, uh, the defy ecosystem or other staple operators. I think we've seen some alliances there, but really, you know, having a, a member Alliance of defy for us, I think is a very, uh, powerful tool, um, and consortium so that we can work together, collaborate on innovative ideas.

[00:26:39] Some of the things that we need, uh, for. Um, our defy dots to function and co-exist certain technology innovative, um, things that we can look at together as a collective and share that information and insight. So as to empower really every protocol, but we see in all alliances and other areas of the industry, and we feel that this, uh, the CDA will be a very powerful one going forward and how we kind of tie in very well.

[00:27:07] In fact, to the decentralized confession. We see a lot of benefits to not only the Alliance, but how we can work alongside the DCF longterm, uh, and be a really an anchoring pillar of what the DCF is doing on a much grander scale for the eco on the highest level. And this is not what we initially came out to do, but this is kind of what it's evolved into is we want to provide the defy infrastructure for people to be their own bank.

[00:27:37] We are not interested in being a bank at all. We're interested in providing those primitives in the defy space for both individuals to take advantage of them and other protocols to take advantage of them. So you have this concept of money Legos, what we're looking to do in this space with relation to money Legos, which is this idea of being able to put pieces in the space together to create new products build on the existing elements.

[00:28:05] We want to take those pieces and expose interfaces to them in the wallet or in the app that allows the end customer to put them together. Not just on an API level for the developers to put them together. So exposing these gives us the ability to have partnerships with lots of different other protocols, and also then bring that to the whole of the market and money Legos are great because they allow you to put these different pieces together and make different products out of them.

[00:28:37] But that is typically the domain. Of other defy protocols, right? So you have all of a and comp and curve and these protocols and you put them together with unit swab and you get a different product. You do yield farming, things like that. What if you take that concept and you expand it out to the end user?

[00:28:57] So it's not just lay money, Legos for other protocols. It's money Legos for end users. This is what we see the vision of DFI DFI, 2.0, whatever you want to call it. And this is what we're trying to sort of come to terms with and deploy into the market on Cardona.

[00:29:18] It's impressive thing on kind of notice how kind of focused on decentralized identity reify. And I think that one of the, one of the things that we can do other chain cannot do is treading between Fiat and cryptocurrency, normally to trash fire. You need KYC, right? Essentially . I hope that in the future next on Carano can similarly have actually imagery and fire and cryptocurrency.

[00:29:46] And that will be also, uh, all that we are moving towards. The Cardona ecosystem brings a lot of unique possibilities for businesses, developers, and users. So personally I beat on mobile pro but firms in general, more than 60% of users who use mobile applications instead of this tops once, uh, if the products has a desktop version, of course, uh, that's not the kind of long-term vision.

[00:30:12] Uh, but, uh, we still need the technical tools to interact with IOTs. So protocols properly on mobile platforms. Uh, this is my kind of, uh, business vision of the current city. Uh, talking about the scientific component, uh, of the vision. I think that the long-term is. Let's say five years. Uh, the boundaries between the various blockchains and blockchain projects will blur and, uh, defy and de OBS will become some kind of super apps.

[00:30:48] Uh, when you have, uh, integrated, uh, the wallet, uh, defy services and NFTs in one single application. We evolve already, uh, envisioned, uh, they integration of ergo, uh, into an ecosystem like these and, uh, the hope our future roadmap to be honest is built on this idea. The Cardinal ecosystem is still pretty young.

[00:31:17] Uh, so initially, uh, developers will need to resolve basic and fundamental, uh, problems, uh, for example, uh, developing, uh, ecosystem stable coin or a robust and functional Explorer because current solutions. Uh, not so good. Uh, we faced all of these issues when we was building ergo and ergo ecosystem and deal.

[00:31:46] These a kind of initial issues were resolved. It was impossible to develop serious product level decentralized applications. As we already faced all of these initial issues, uh, develop an ergo. We will provide Cordato ecosystem with, uh, our, uh, solution. We was, we used, uh, development, ergo. We have already developed our own Explorer on Cardona and we use it well, developing our, uh, or good X application and a.

[00:32:21] Uh, where are thinking about to, to, uh, distribute these application for, to, for the community and share our experience with other projects. Okay. I dunno. It's really strong right now. And especially after some tests where, uh, anyone who. To create union swap based, uh, decks initially just sold that it's a mistake and there is no way of, uh, you know, cloning, the new swap.

[00:32:47] And right now there's a lot of really interesting ideas. Uh, many, uh, like Melodics like Sandra swap, uh, Th they are continuously bringing some new ideas of how to solve or maybe not, or maybe it's not how to solve, but how to create something new because it's, it's about it. And it's not, it's not about pushing hard, the union swap way, but finding the best way for you.

[00:33:17] Take self a model. And after a couple of years, I really strongly believe in general defy. It will be dire, uh, on a regular finances markets, regular FinTech. Uh, and this is why I'm building my own lawn just to be there when it happens. And when it happens, in my opinion is going to be the moment when the regulators accept it, you know, enough way.

[00:33:47] So that. Finances guys can just tell, okay. I love cryptocurrencies. I love blockchain because right now everyone is publicly. They say, no, no, no, we don't want it. But you know, behind the cartoons, the, the, they are all into it. So we expect that moment. I expect that moment to happen soon. And in that time, there will be real banking on a block.

[00:34:13] In the future. I see Byron network as an open source group of friends that deliver, uh, some solutions and some, and uh, in general platform that you can build many other projects. Um, let's say for now we start with open sourcing our code and, uh, let, let the people using it, let people using it and building their own platform, their own apps.

[00:34:41] And later on. At some point, we should all get together and bring the adoption to Cardinal because it's, it's designed for it. Uh, later on let's, let's have Hydra, uh, the second layer that you know, who knows what can happen, then you can bring even more ideas. And this is what, what I want to achieve. I want to build, I want to get in there and build a community strong community that believes in.

[00:35:11] Thank you so much to each of the projects that presented today, uh, we were really excited for what you guys are doing, and we're excited to see the future of your projects on Cartano. Uh, and thank you to everybody for watching today's, uh, iteration of the building on Cardona series. And we'll be coming back to you soon with more.

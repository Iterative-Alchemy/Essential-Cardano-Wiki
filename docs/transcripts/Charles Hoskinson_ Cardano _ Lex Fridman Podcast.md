# Charles Hoskinson_ Cardano _ Lex Fridman Podcast

[00:00:00] The following is a conversation with Charles Hoskinson, founder of car Dano co-founder of Ethereum and a mathematician. Who's one of the most well-read and knowledgeable people on the technical side of cryptocurrency that I've ever spoken to quick mention of our sponsors, gala games, all form, indeed expressive PN, and a sleep.

[00:00:23] Check them out in the description to support this podcast. As a side note, let me say that Charles is not just a mathematician or cryptocurrency innovator, but also a Colorado based farmer of bison and mushrooms, a gamer, a fishermen, and a world traveler. When I asked him if he has a nice professional picture of himself, he sent me a picture of him in Mongolia with a Hawk on his shoulder meeting the Mongolian president.

[00:00:52] That to me pretty much says it all speaking to the humor and the intelligence of a man who's bold, innovative does not shy away from a bit of fun and a bit of controversy, which makes him a fascinating human being to explore ideas with. I do want to say in terms of ideas, that at least to me, cryptocurrency is much bigger than just the way for a few Americans to make a quick buck through meme driven speculation.

[00:01:19] It is technology that enables freedom from oppression, from suffering in the world because money is power Mongolia. For example, was a reminder of that for me next day, after talking with Charles, I spoke with Wyoming park who's in north Korean defector and who spent time in Mongolia as many defectors do in her and their escape from North Korea, her story, the story of North Korea, the story of atrocities throughout the 20th century, committed by Hitler, Stalin, and others is a reminder that the world is full of darkness, but it is also full of beauty and love.

[00:01:57] And it is a world worth fighting for, and every way we know how this is a Friedman podcast, and here is my conversation with Charles Hoskinson. Let's start with a fun question. If we're living in a simulation. What programming language do you think it's written in and, uh, maybe from a software engineering perspective, what do you think are some of the design principles that operates under?

[00:02:22] You know, there's a lot of really lovely papers. Like, uh, one came out of MSR, the autodidactic universe. Did you have a chance to see that, oh, you gotta read it. It's like April of 27, 21. It's just brand new. But basically the idea is that the universe is like some sort of giant self-learning system that can self evolve almost like gnomic.

[00:02:39] And then you have Wolfram running around saying, Hey, we can come up with these very simple rules and we can reconstruct all of reality at some arbitrary point. Uh, so I have absolutely no idea what's right. And I, I look at it kind of like a formal system. And I say, well, if you're stuck within the system, it's hard to actually understand that you're inside the system.

[00:02:57] You know, it's kind of like a, um, an object language to a metal language. You know, there's this thing that is outside of it, but because you're constrained and limited by the simulation, you can't really understand the nature of the thing that's outside of it. Uh, it's almost like Minecraft. You can build these Redstone computers within Minecraft and simulate, emulate things within it, but you really can't go outside of that, uh, environment, people outside of a conformity prove that it's correct or whatever, but the creatures inside of the system.

[00:03:25] Hope to perfectly understand and improve something about it. Also, the question is it's a computation question, you know, does P equal NP because you'd have to be able to emulate all of the long would take. Yeah, exactly. And so, so I have no clue what type of language you would have to look like, but, um, it would probably not be anything we're used to at the moment.

[00:03:45] It'd have to be something else and we'd have to have some more fundamental resolution of, of the relationship, these formal systems and how they get extended. So that's like a 22nd century question instead of the 21st century. You like, do you find the Stephen Wolf from idea compelling? That's a very different way of programming, which is you set some rules, you set some initial conditions and let it run and see what happens.

[00:04:06] Okay. Yeah. And it's not a new concept. I mean, like the Santa Fe, Institute's been doing that for a long time and you can use it for economic modeling and you can show that in certain cases, there's this concept of simple rules evolving into a complex system is somewhat more predictive than trying to build a complex top-down model for things.

[00:04:23] And I guess there's some analogies, these things in AI, where are you going to just start with some simple things? And then somehow it just figure stuff out and its environment over time and much better than if you actually tried to model it prologue or something like that. So that, that is exciting because you get to just do a few things, let this thing run and then see what happens.

[00:04:43] And that's a lot of fun. In fact, it got so exciting. Wolfram came to us and he said, Hey, let's do an NFT marketplace. And I said, what do you want to do? And he said, I got all these universes to sell. I said, okay, well, that's going to be fun. So we're going to set up an auction system or something like that with him.

[00:04:57] And I think maybe end of this month or next month, we'll, uh, we'll figure out how to do NFTs on Cardona with, uh, with Wolfram universes. So as soon as we can sell one, I'll give you one. And then we can all just claim that we're living in some sort of Wolfram simulator. Um, I don't know how much money I have, but I'm going to give everything.

[00:05:13] I have to get rule 30, which is one of his universes that he's created. One of the ones, one of the first ones where he discovered, uh, some interesting, uh, complexities he's turning complete or is that 45? I can't remember which one. I think, you know your stuff, actually. I'm not sure if they proved anything about rule 30 in terms of whether it's turn complete or not, but there's fun competitions on it, which is trying to predict something about rule 30, by the way, it evolves.

[00:05:39] And so far nobody's been able to do it, just like looking at the middle column, try to predict as the system evolves, say anything like conclusively. The future of the systems that evolves is fascinating. It's both a beautiful, that simple rules can create that kind of complexity. And it's also sad that we can't like make perfect sense of it.

[00:06:03] Like perfectly predict the future, even though it's all simple and deterministic, we can't say something conclusive about like, when the thing will end, when will this little cellular automata like evolve in certain way and then Euclid weapons will be invented. I blow each other up and then it'll just be this empty one, desalinate automata.

[00:06:21] Well, doesn't that make it fun though? Yeah, it's fun. But when you're trying to create, and we'll talk about, uh, something that operates the economy and the way humans transact and cooperate and fall in love and work together, then you'd like to be a little bit more formal, try to say something conclusive.

[00:06:42] If this entire universe is just cellular automata, then, um, th th being conclusive as kind of hopeless, generally speaking, and the hope is I guess, that there'll be pockets of which of within the cellular automata, where you could be predictive. We can be, we can formerly show that something is true and then you can rely on that.

[00:07:03] You'll be resilient and all those kinds of things, even though the rest of the thing is a giant mess. That's on predicting, they call that Laplas as demon. Yes. Well, I wonder what the demon is up to these days. Okay. Thank you for entertaining me with that, but sticking on philosophy, you've also mentioned among others, that Bertrand Russell and a saw cookie or two of your favorite philosophers, uh, maybe you can comment on what ideas of theirs you find insightful.

[00:07:31] And also, what do you use the difference? Because you're both an engineer. And the thinker. So what do you use the difference between philosophy and computer science? Yeah, so yeah, there's both a deeply human element to both Russell and saw, and then there's this of course amazing work that they did in the late 19th and 20th century.

[00:07:50] And you can't really talk about. Uh, Russell or assault without also mentioning Vic and shine. And, uh, Torsky you know, because when you actually look at these guys and you put them together, what they were attempting to do was increase the level of precision we had in analyzing both formal languages and also language in general.

[00:08:08] And so eviction should, I makes no sense at all to me. So I there's, there's amazing people out there that somehow can parse that, but he doesn't make sense to himself either. I think you're right about that. However, crypto has crypto pinch dine. Yeah. Is he, has, he has his, he has his, his whole building on that.

[00:08:24] Right. And he built a whole higher and at least there, I have modal logic and I have the little boxes and, and I have the diamonds and I can do a computation. And I can kind of reason about things that are, people are saying. Uh, but it really was all just about providing, uh, precision and the nature of truth precision and the nature of necessity and possibility.

[00:08:41] And the magic of these statements is that you can then start getting a better understanding of, of basically how far formal language can take you. And so that's the, that's the work of it. And, uh, David Hilbert also did the same thing. And Russell, he got his career started working with Alfred north Whitehead.

[00:08:59] He was a logistician and there was this whole desire and late 19th century mathematics to formalize mathematics and a completely new and better way. And they started with geometry and Hilbert's geometry was like a complete system, although recently discovered as a few holes in that. But for the most part is complete and you know, the axioms are independent and they're consistent.

[00:09:20] And they said, oh, well, now we can do this for all of them. And Russell and Whitehead wrote this huge set of, of books, like two big books, Principia, Mathematica thousand pages, and the conclusions one plus one equals two. So they, they linked set theory and arithmetic and logic all in these beautiful ways.

[00:09:36] Then little by little as we entered the 20th century, a logician started chipping away at this idea that you could actually construct a complete system of, uh, mathematics first with girdle. And then later with the work of touring and church and others, they said, oh, you're not complete. You're not decidable.

[00:09:52] And so suddenly Russell was left in this really bad position where his early life's work was, was basically forgotten. So he had to kind of reinvent himself. And so he wanted to ethics and he went into different fields of philosophy. He became just tightened in analytic philosophy and he was also a great pacifist.

[00:10:08] And, and he was just a phenomenal writer. You know, uh, if you read why I'm not a Christian or any of his other attacks on, on metaphysics, you know, he said, look, I can only deal with the world I'm in, in the census that I have. And if I can deduce it, I believe it. If it's outside of that, I really can't make meaningful statements about it.

[00:10:25] And he said it in a lovely English prose that you would expect of a man of his stature now. So crit Cree, it was like the complete opposite. This guy is really down to earth, dude, not aristocratic at all. And you know, he, he was one of those guys that just could have done anything because he was so he's so brilliant.

[00:10:42] I guess he's still alive. I think he's 80 something. Yeah, he's, he's getting up there, man. But I mean, literally when he was in high school, he wrote these papers and logic and Harvard contacted him, said, Hey, could you teach graduate courses at Harvard? And he said, no, I really would like to finish high school first before I go and teach grad school at Harvard.

[00:10:59] And so this is just one of those guys that you, you can see through his work that he can think deeply about anything it's like the Galois philosophy. And he chose to try to clean up a lot of the messes that tar ski and others couldn't resolve. He said, let's really get serious about the nature of truth.

[00:11:15] Let's really try to resolve paradoxes. Let's really try to build things in such a way that the work that we leave behind can actually be built upon, and it's not thrown away every 50 years or a hundred years. Uh, there was a Stanford Starsky comes in and he says, we mathematicians love this concept of truth, but yet we've never really created a nice rigorous definition that, that doesn't have paradoxes embedded inside of it.

[00:11:36] So he had two metal languages and object language and all these notions and so forth. So I really liked those those four, if you think about them, and there's a lot of great lessons and where it's relevant today is, you know, you have human beings and you have computers, and they're trying to understand each other.

[00:11:51] And computers live in the formal world and human beings live in a natural language world. And those bridges between those two are still not completely clear. And so a lot of the work that these guys were doing the 20th century 19th century had nothing at all to do with that, but gives you hope that perhaps a bridge can exist between those two worlds.

[00:12:10] And maybe there are some nice tools for that bridge to be built upon. And maybe that in some way will allow computers to better understand us. I mean, they've even created languages, natural spoken languages that are completely ambiguity free, like Loach bond and things like that. What, yeah. Right. Well, hello.

[00:12:25] J B a N Loge bond is based on a language called log land and it's a spoken language. That's the equivalent to first-order predicate calculus. Okay. Oh, interesting. So no ambiguity is it's logically consistent. Yeah. can you still have fun in it? Like you can get you to write poetry or there's people who actually write poetry and load your bot, and we're going to switch to that.

[00:12:45] Yeah, I started tweeting and yeah, there you go. Uh, so, so, you know, there's a lot, a lot there and they're just fun to study and think about. And unfortunately, if you go down that rabbit hole, it, uh, it you'll spend way, way too much time and there's diminishing returns. Now the second question you asked was one on theoretical computer science to, I guess, no OrthoFi no, no, no, no, no.

[00:13:04] So first step you said humans and computers, right? So theoretical computer science is theory of the computer and philosophy is the theory of the human. And then we can dissect different stuff about the computer, but in terms of these two worlds of the theory of the human, which is philosophy and the theory of the computer, which is computer science, what do you think is the difference?

[00:13:25] Like, as we try to bridge that gap, as you mentioned, what is going to. Be, uh, the biggest challenge, like, can we formalize love? Can we formalize music, art, poetry, all the kind of stuff, or is that a human nonsense that we need to get rid of? No, I don't think it's human nonsense at all. I'm in there's even attempts to create algorithmically generated music.

[00:13:47] And, you know, the question is, is, is love just strictly a chemical phenomenon or something like metaphysical about it, or transcendent of, uh, of some sort of formal system. I mean, computer science is just saying, Hey, we have this notion of computing. We have this, this brain that we've constructed, this formal system that we've built.

[00:14:08] And given that we have it, what can we do with it? And so some people worry about the roots of the tree of knowledge, you know, the great of computer science. They worry about the ruts and say, how far can we grow them? And let's keep adding these new models of computation and other people worry about the trunk of the tree.

[00:14:25] And some people worry about the leaves of the tree and the more advanced the field gets the closer and closer it gets to the people who constructed it. Us, you know, we have better image processing. We have better ways of handling speech to texts, and we have better ways of computers kind of understanding the intent of what a human being is saying.

[00:14:45] And then the question is, well, how will the computer understand love or poetry or music? Well, it'll, don't understand it the same way we understand it. You have to get a computer to grow up to a point where can learn the way we learn or as close to it as possible. Then you just expose it to the things that we were exposed with.

[00:15:01] And then at some point the computer will start creating things. So the question is, well, how do you quantify creativity? And I have no clue about that. What did you make it into an NFT and see how much Excel sport that's one way, but basically, yeah, there's so much of it is subjective and that that's a fascinating whole area of that.

[00:15:21] I'm fascinated with this human robot interaction is how do we create compelling experiences that are subjectively compelling, whether it's art or just two humans talking, or two humans interacting in some kind of way to maximize the richness of the subjective experience. And I think that could be an optimization problem that could be solved.

[00:15:39] We're solving it all the time. Right? Human civilization is constantly trying to, we're constantly trying to impress each other or younger trying to get laid, right? Uh, whatever, fall in love, impress your boss at work, buy all the awesome stuff you do. I mean, we're trying to optimize that problem as. For the most part is subjective.

[00:15:59] Right. Did you ever watch blade runner 2049? Yes. Yeah. Did you remember the whole relationship between joy and K? You know, and like it, did she really love him the hologram or not? Was it like fake love or real love fake it till you make it as my view on love a no comment from Charles. So let's, uh, let's go to the difference between, uh, theoretical computer science and software engineering, or, um, I don't know if you draw a distinction, but if we look into this computer world now, is there a difference between theory things you can say formally and the programmatic implementation of that theory into actual systems that people use?

[00:16:36] Yeah. Which I will, I guess we'll call software engineering. So, you know, the engineer they're obsessed with the domain of, well, what do you want to accomplish and who are you accomplishing it for? So they live in the world of people, if they're good engineers and they say, okay, what's the experience, uh, you know, how are we going to use this?

[00:16:54] Why are we going to do this? What's the commercial application, what's the non-commercial application. And you collect all these business requirements. And when, once you've done all of that, the better job you do, the more self-evident it is of how do we apply the toys and tools of computer science and other, such things to actually resolve that.

[00:17:13] And the point of theoretical computer science from the software engineering domain is it can tell you kind of where your guard rails are. It won't make perfect programs, and there's no such thing as that, but rather it can give you a good notion. It sense that your program has some desirable properties like it, maybe it'll, you can prove that it can terminate if you're dealing with total programs or maybe you can prove you'll never have a buffer overflow, or, you know, you'll demote divide by zero somewhere or something like that.

[00:17:41] You know, some event won't occur that'll cause a catastrophic failure in your system, but there's always this competent Loreal explosion between what you can test and think about and what you can actually do. So the stuff on the left-hand side lives in eight different cardinality, different universe, there's something significantly larger there.

[00:17:59] And the tools on the right-hand side, you know, we have property-based testing and these sat solvers, we have all this great stuff here in formal methods, land and computer science theory land, but there's only a small subset of things that they actually give you. Answers about. So the balance of the two things is basically saying, well, what do you care about and what are you okay.

[00:18:19] Throwing away. That's the art of engineering and building these types of things. So, you know, cryptocurrencies, we deal with these complex distributed systems that have cryptography and game theory and Byzantine actors. Uh, so the balance there is saying, okay, what can't fail in that system. And that's the kind of stuff that you want to apply as heavy a tool set as you can, because when that stuff fails, either have the loss of billions of dollars privacy or potentially even life, depending on how these systems get adopted, but then other things, you know, what can fail?

[00:18:52] Is it okay if the block doesn't get made every, you know, every now and that is okay, if your latency goes up or your, your network suddenly becomes a synchronous and you know, you disconnect from it, you have restart the computer or something like that. That's probably okay, it's an inconvenience and burden to the user.

[00:19:09] And if you actually try to chase that tail, you'll end up spending 10 years chasing Phantoms and ghosts. And meanwhile, you know, the whole world moves on. So it's really figuring out those balance of the two. And what's really beautiful is that the formal methods tools have gotten so much better over the last 20 years in particular, mostly because of incredibly high investments from Microsoft and Google and big universities, because these guys are building these gargantuan systems.

[00:19:34] If you look at the Google Plex or what Amazon has or others, and they have so much value, so many users, so many things going on and no person can keep that in there. And so you're talking about systems may have 10 million lines of code, 15 million lines of code millions of nodes, connecting faulty processes happening all the time, hackers breaking in on a regular basis.

[00:19:56] So when you're trying to model all of that, trying to ask yourself what formal guarantees and properties can I get to simplify this system as much as possible. So instead of the applications of formal methods slowing you down, in many cases, it actually massively reduces your debugging time and your ability to find where errors occur.

[00:20:13] In some cases you can't find where errors occurrence. So these massive concurrent systems, and you say, well, we're a cryptocurrencies going, we're talking about just the same thing, but we're talking about a much more hostile operating environment where instead of it running in a pristine data center in California, somewhere it's running on your cell phone, it's running on your mom's phone, it's running your dad's phone, it's running on, you know, some computer in Mongolia that may have good internet on Tuesday, but not any other day.

[00:20:39] So when you live in that kind of environment, you, you really do need to think carefully about a whole new class of protocols. And then you need to think carefully about a whole new class of tools and techniques to test the reliability of those systems. And you need to separate the world and say, what is high assurance and cannot fail.

[00:20:55] Cause if it feels people lose money and what is low assurance and it's okay if that falls apart. The other thing I'll mention is there a perverse financial incentives in our industry, because the reality is when something blows up, the people who built those things that blow up usually get paid upfront.

[00:21:11] So what they're focusing on is time to market speed to market and getting tokens out and getting them. And me, and then people come in, they buy it. But if there's a NYSCI bug in some defy protocol, it'll probably be discovered six months later or something like that. It blows up who suffers the users.

[00:21:27] They already got the people that created the other already got paid. Exactly. That's why you pay the guy who makes the break software for your train last and you made sure he writes the train every day. Uh, so that that's, that you're basically describing the complexity of a distributed system. That's fundamental game theoretic.

[00:21:45] And like, if we think about turtles all the way down as humans, all the way down, I mean, you, at the very bottom of still human nature, is there something you can say formerly about human nature to try? You said you can't, there's certain parts of the system that can't fail. You know, some people talk about nuclear war in that same kind of way that there's this game, theoretic construction of mutually assured destruction.

[00:22:10] Well, that rhymes, see, I'm a poet. That system can't fail because we're going to blow everyone up, but you can't formally say for sure, it's not going to fail. Right? So like you're basically trying to chase like statistically reduce the probability that the, these particular critical aspects will fail. And then you test, I guess, by deploying in the real world as small scale to see where things go wrong.

[00:22:35] Yeah. It's a great question. And you know, the, the problem with game theory and mechanism design is that you can develop this concept of a rational actor. And I don't think in my life I've ever met a rational actor. You know, there's a rational actor on Tuesday, but you know, any other day of the week, who the hell knows, and there's even, I think there was a book Freakonomics, and there's a few of these things where it just shows again and again, where people behave in ways that are against their best interest.

[00:22:57] So then you have these protocol designers and they say, well, we need an honest majority for this thing to work. Uh, and they say, okay, well, we'll create this incentive model. And rational actors will behave with that incentive model as well. The individual won't do that, but the firm, the government, the entity will, the problem with that is we have a lot of counter-examples where the system was actually.

[00:23:18] Behaving in weird ways. Like we almost completely eradicated the human population twice in the 20th century, once during the Cuban missile crisis. And again, in the 1980s, there was a Russian Colonel and they installed a new satellite system and it said, Hey, the Americans are launching missile status. You need to turn the key in, you know, launch all the missiles in the silo.

[00:23:36] And he said, oh, that's not right. That, that doesn't seem right. And he was reprimanded for not launching the missiles. Uh, so in both cases, a single person stood against the systems of superpowers between us and nuclear annihilation. Uh, so in general, we're really bad at building these types of things. So what you look for instead is they can the system be self correct?

[00:23:59] It's not about avoiding a problem. It's more about can the problem be resolved and that's how nature engineers things, it gives you an immune system. It gives you the ability to heal. If a rainforest has a fire or some catastrophic event, the, the ecosystem will find a way to patch things up. So it's a better question of how do you align the incentives over the long-term of a system where all the actors within this system, when an event occurs that disrupts it have an incentive to push it back into a healthy, productive, useful state, which is going back kind of to that complexity theory stuff that we began with.

[00:24:33] And a little bit about, you know, how do you handle modern economics? Like for example, we knew this, uh, coming into the COVID crisis, that there would be catastrophic economic disruption throughout the entire world. And the development developed world, it was print lots of money and hope to God. It works.

[00:24:49] And the developing world is try not to starve to death over a hundred million people were pushed into acute starvation. So Huet hunger, a terrible situation, but every economist knew we were going into that. So the question is, how do you restart the system? How do you realign the system and so forth and make sure that it doesn't collapse at some, uh, at some point, so it's an imperfect inexact science.

[00:25:10] Um, and that's actually one of the things that makes our industry so much fun is that these are kind of like micro experiments for the macro. In the years past, you never got a chance to experiment with monetary policy. I mean, it's like every 20 years, 30 years you'd have some conference, usually in a cool island like Jamaica and be like, okay, let's go talk about monetary policy and like amend the Bretton woods agreement.

[00:25:33] And these would be nation states invitation only. And now you have over 8,000 cryptocurrencies floating around all with their own monetary policy and their rules. And it's very Darwinian, a lot are dying. Some are succeeding, anomalies happen like doge coin. And you say, God, is this temporary? Is this permanent?

[00:25:48] Why doesn't this horrible thing die? And then other things you think would be absolutely successful and just take off and be in the top 10, don't really get as much traction like Al grant is a great example of that. I mean, Silvio is, he's incredibly bright guy. Every time I go to MIT, we have dinner and you know, his work is, is legendary and it's just beautiful and elegant.

[00:26:09] And he literally has all the people. He went and hired tall Robin and you know, she got it. IBM research and Craig Gentry, the guy did homomorphic encryption on her damn phone Hayes. There, there's all these amazing people on that team. And they have money in the VCs. So you'd say, okay, that's a contender.

[00:26:25] But if you look at market adoption, Ethereum classic. Sometimes it's above it and other things are puppets and there's this weird Darwinian evolution produced a doge coin organism that is just like stomping all around evolution. Doesn't make sense, but maybe it's w w we're the problem not evolution, you know, cause the market's the market and, uh, you know, you can scream and cry and pout and stamp your foot and said, this makes no sense, but that's the way the world works.

[00:26:52] You know, there's plenty of mountain climbers that didn't want gravity to apply to them. And it's the same situation here. It's, there's plenty of people in these marketplaces that had the best of intentions, the best team, the best technology, and for whatever reason, they didn't get that adoption. So the question isn't the local, it should be the long-term and will the system over time converged to a state that actually is useful and meaningful to society and actually solve problems for it.

[00:27:18] And that's a, that's what we try to figure out is, you know, how do we perturb these things in a way to kind of push them in that direction? So before we go into this fascinating Darwinian evolution of cryptocurrencies, um, let me ask you sort of a basic programming question. There's a fascinating aspect to your work with Cardinals that use Haskell as, um, to build the infrastructure, but even stepping back, more looking at this landscape, another place where Darwinian evolution operates, looking at this landscape of programming languages, you as an engineer, you as a philosopher, both what programming languages do you think are interesting and will practically what program languages, if you were to advise like students today, should they learn?

[00:28:05] Yeah. So there's the pedagogy of learning how to program and to express the theory of computer science. Like you have to learn how to write algorithms. You have to learn what data structures are. You have to be able to do analysis of these things. And that probably the, I think the debate is over Python is probably the best language or JavaScript to get started with because they're very useful.

[00:28:26] The libraries are amazing. There's just tons of online materials. Even MIT is now teaching their introduction to computer science and Python. Uh, and they used to do lists. I mean, these, these guys were hardcore, still love lists IO, man. It's great. You know, these, these are your father's parentheses. They're elegant weapons from, uh, from a time long ago.

[00:28:44] Uh, but you know, that's, that's a great starting point and it's not about falling in love with the language. It's just falling in love with computing. It's about falling in love with having a dialogue with a computer and thinking about, well, how would I solve that? How would I interact with that? What, what does this need to look like?

[00:28:59] Um, functional programming is what we've chosen to use for Cartano mostly because we're living in the academic world. We were in 105 papers. And the problem is you have to translate that work into code and the gap between an imperative language, like a C plus plus or C. And these academic rigorous papers is extremely large.

[00:29:20] And so there's going to be a lot of semantical ambiguity between those two. And what I mean by that is that you might end up implementing. As a wrong thing, you might think that what you've built is the paper, but the computer's not going to tell you that because the paper's written in prose and maybe typed up in LayTec or something, but there's no proof chain evidence chain that you can show that there's no ambiguity.

[00:29:42] When you look at a functional language, you're a little closer to math. And so as a consequence, the translation of the papers that we spent, so damn long writing and writing proofs about and so forth to code is much smaller. Now the downside is these functional languages tend to be a bit more academic and they tend to have not necessarily the best windows support and the libraries aren't so good.

[00:30:03] And also they tend to be a little slower when compared as a whole on average two languages, like C for example. So it's really a question of, okay, what are you designing for for version one? Are you designing for performance and are you designing for developer accessibility? Are you designing for correctness and are you designing for, uh, the, a high fidelity representation of the.

[00:30:27] Okay. So Haskell was chosen as kind of the version one, because we knew that the kinds of people who think about that are also the kinds of people that would have an easy time reading a paper like world Boris and working their way through all of this. And they would do a pretty good job running a formal specification, and then translating that into running code.

[00:30:47] Then what you have that you have a blueprint that you can actually reason about maintain. And if you really wanted to, you could then turn that into a rest code base or into a Java code base going the other way around would be, you know, kind of, kind of pointless and counter productive. The other side of it is that Casco code or functional code tends to be significantly more concise.

[00:31:09] And I actually have a real life example of that. So if you take a look at Metis, w w we implemented a full Ethereum node in Scala, it's only about 14 or 15,000 lines of code, and you compare that with like C plus plus Bitcoin. I think that's 120, 150,000 lines of code. So it's almost 10 times smaller and so less code, less to read.

[00:31:31] And you tend to read code significantly more than you would, uh, read a write code. So it's always an advantage for me. Understandability documentation and other things, when you have more concise code basis. And also it's, it's a lot easier for you to apply a law, uh, stronger tools to a functional code base, uh, like static analysis or property-based testing or these types of things, uh, than an imperative code base.

[00:31:57] But, you know, the thing is it's, it's almost like a religion it's like say, or, or language it's like saying what's French versus Russian versus English. Everybody has their adherence say, oh, they have the best poetry here or Russian. Yeah, there you go. Always write Russia. Everybody has their favorite tools and their, their, their favorite languages, but it just comes down to what problems are you trying to solve?

[00:32:16] And what problem domain do you live in? If you're inventing new protocols based on science, you're going to take the time to write a paper, go through the peer review process. Uh, as you've done personally, you know how hard it can be to get into a conference and go through that, get your ass kicked. Then you also have to apply the exact same level of care to the engineering side, in terms of the implementation of that, or else you will make a mistake.

[00:32:39] And that mistake will probably be an exploit in the system that destroys the security properties of the system. So we really had no choice, but to go to some notion of functional, the question was what's the Goldilocks language. Do you use a hybrid language like Scala and F sharp or closure where you still have some connection to understandable things like.net or the JVM?

[00:33:00] Or do you go to an overly academic language like Idris or act or, you know, Isabel and there you can read. Dial up the correctness and write all kinds of crazy proofs. But by the way, it's like the seven people who write your code, they go on vacation a lot. You'll never get anything done. So Haskell kind of felt like a nice middle ground between those two, where we needed to pull into the left.

[00:33:22] We could, if you wanted to pull into the right, you could as well, that said, it's really amazing to see what the hybrid languages have done. If I was a new student in computer science, and I said, you know, learn any language to grow your career from a scholar. Three is probably the language to go with.

[00:33:37] Interesting. Yeah, it's great. Cause it's like, you want it to be like Java Java and it looks kind of like a Java program. You want it to be like Python and scripted and you use a rebel. You can do that. You want to go hardcore dot, you know, to dependent object types and do like weird proofs and stuff. And the functional you do all that.

[00:33:55] You have access to all of these things. And Martin is a brilliant guy. He's done some phenomenal work basically. Cause he was, he was one guy created the JVM and he's worked on compilers for over 20 years. He did a lot of really hardcore work and trying to build a concise, nice, modern language that does a little bit of.

[00:34:13] And it's got great applications in data science and an AI it's also heavily used in modern companies like Netflix uses Scala for all of their microservice architecture. Yeah. So there's, that's a great language and it's easy to pick up and it's easy to hire people into it. You just find these Eastern European guys were Java programmers for 10 years, 15 years, and they got tired of making $20 an hour.

[00:34:34] So they picked up Scala so they can make $35 an hour. And they're really good at it, you know? And that's a great gateway drug because you know, like quick check and Haskell, you have scholar check and scholar, you know, you can also bill do model checking. You can also go and use a TLA spec and make it work with Scala and so forth.

[00:34:52] So it's a, it gets you a little bit of everything and you know, you can then move around that entire design space in a beautiful way. So the recommendation is, uh, maybe if you want to go vanilla, go Python and JavaScript when you're getting started getting, and that'll get you everything. Even your web scrapers and anything it's experiment with drugs and undergrad.

[00:35:14] This was where Scala three comes in. It's a gateway drug to them potentially more hardcore functional languages like Haskell. Do you think CNC plus plus C plus plus still has a role? No, I think rusty has completely replaced the need for them go and rust. And you know, those are the, the two twins of doom.

[00:35:30] I mean, Google created go just to get rid of, see, they hated to see that much. And then rust is just a phenomenal language as well. It can be a great motivator. Yeah. Let me ask a question from Reddit on this topic. We're going depth first today. Um, as a developer, why should I be incentivized to create Cardona based applications?

[00:35:50] What is on the Cardona developer roadmap and the other language? I guess this is the key question I want to ask any other language support, other than Haskell example, this person gives us TypeScript go Java Python, et cetera. Also, have you considered a yearly conference focused on developers? Uh, yeah, we call it Plutus Fest and we, we did the first one in 20.

[00:36:12] 18 20 19. I can't remember. And we were going to do one last year, but then COVID hit. So we'll, we'll bring it back. And we'll probably do it annually at the university of Wyoming for their hackathon there. In fact, it just so happens that coincides with the Gogan summit. So we're doing that, I think the third week of September, but yeah, it's great to do an annual conference.

[00:36:29] You can read a lot of cool people together and you can do hackathons and awards and so forth. But to the question in particular, uh, Plutus is, is like any other language police core, you can compile things into it. So it's entirely possible to write a scholar deplete his core compiler or a TypeScript compiler or something like that.

[00:36:47] But, you know, I'm a big believer of, of separation of concerns and we don't live in a single chain model anymore. Uh, so you know, you have a situation where you probably want to have different execution environments in different chains, so you have different virtual machines there. And that's why we work so closely with the university of Illinois or about a champagne or gory Roshi his team at runtime verification.

[00:37:09] What they did is they said, let's start with something very familiar LLVM, which has been around for a really long time. And they happen to have created it there with apple. And let's take that and translate that into the blockchain space. Okay. Then what you have. Then it's very easy to modify compilers of standard languages like the CS and C plus pluses and other such things that do compile to LLVM already and have them run there.

[00:37:33] So that's a different execution model than what we tried to build for Pluto's, which focuses on correctness. Okay. So then all you have to really do is say, can both of these models co-exist within the same ecosystem. Cause then you kind of, and I, I did a video, it was called like the island, the ocean, the pond, and the basic idea was say, you have an island where everything's perfect Calypso lives.

[00:37:52] There. Life is great. Uh, you know, people feed you grapes every day, but maybe you can't do everything on the island, you know, and the ocean is big. It has everything, but the ocean has got sea monsters and sharks and Boaty McBoatface and you know, all kinds of crazy stuff. Right? So that's what yellow is about.

[00:38:10] It's basically this, this bring LLVM into our world. And at some point in the next three to five-year time horizon, we can bring modern programming languages in, but they're going to come in with all their flaws and their awards and their problems. And then, uh, the pond was the idea of the Ethereum virtual machine.

[00:38:26] There's some network effect around it and there's some great tooling. That's a materialized and evolved. And it's not clear if that's the standard yet, or if like MySpace or Blackberry, all these other things it'll fade away. Well, if it becomes a standard, okay, don't, uh, don't fight nature, just support it.

[00:38:42] And the same thing that gives you the ability to, uh, bolt on the LLVM will also give you the ability to bolt on the EVM and they can run with their own models and their encapsulated bulk headed separated systems, but you can move ADA applications, information between those two systems. And so your main chain will always stay somewhat conservative and have the minimum viable amount of expressiveness required on it to do all kinds of interesting things.

[00:39:08] And also for interoperability, be able to talk to all kinds of interesting things, but it's not trying to be everything to everyone. There's never going to be an ice cream store in the island. You'll have the grapes and the beautiful women, but no ice cream. Now you're just like distracting me with the ice cream.

[00:39:23] Uh, so just for, because we'll throw around a bunch of terms for the record, what is Plutus? So is a programming language. It's kind of a DSL that we built on top of Haskell. And, uh, basically we wrote it after spending about three years, thinking about all smart contracts, we were trying to figure out like, what is the ideal language to express a smart contract?

[00:39:44] And then we started saying, well, what is a smart contract? Is it the whole application? Or is it just like a sub-module within an application? And usually it's, it's the latter more than a former, you can build a self-contained program like a script, but usually what's happening is you'll have it like a video game.

[00:39:59] Let's say world of Warcraft or something like that. He said, Hey, maybe I want to actually create gold and world of Warcraft. That's actually a currency, you know? Okay. So I'm going to issue a token. Well, and then maybe I want to create some mechanics behind how people are going to trade that amongst each other.

[00:40:14] So that would be like a smart contract layer and issue and asset. So you have the centralized server running and proprietary software controlled by a single company, but then you've opened your application up to a broader world. And we've done now is added a blockchain layer and the blockchain handles the accounting of that asset and the spending policy of that stuff.

[00:40:34] So that is a much smaller program than what blizzard is doing with world of Warcraft. So the point of Plutus was let's create a language where you can write these small to mid-sized programs and have a high degree of confidence that they behave with correctness. And also they give you deterministic results on the consumption of resources.

[00:40:54] You can run things locally and you actually understand what it costs to run, and that doesn't change when you deploy it on the system. If you dial up the expressiveness of the system and you're like a theorem does, and these, these big mutable account systems, the problem is you have to have global state.

[00:41:09] So whatever you test locally doesn't actually necessarily translate to what you've done. Okay. So we, we spent a long time asking, like, where's the Goldilocks zone Bitcoin script was too restrictive. And every single time Satoshi tried to dial it up, it led to make a problem. It's like there was a beautiful thing called the value overflow incident in 2010, which led to the creation of billions of Bitcoin.

[00:41:32] I had to quickly clean that up and sweep it under the rug and pretend like it didn't exist. But that was mostly because of an issue with how the scripting language was implemented. And when you look at a theorem, it's like this pure game of, of stomping down, these skirmishers where every update, there's something they have to change your tune.

[00:41:50] And then it's not clear how you shard such a model. So we said, let's build something that's in the middle of this. And that's what Plutus basically is. And it's really designed to play very nicely with off-chain infrastructure, as much as on chain infrastructure. So you can look at all those different examples, whether it's Wolfram wants to auction off their universes or blizzard wants to issue an in game currency or your Uber.

[00:42:13] And you want to start putting peer to peer dynamics inside your system. You're going to gracefully connect to that on chain code. And it's very clear how those two things connect together just so happens. Haskell's really good for this. They have template Haskell and it makes it very easy to embed domain specific languages.

[00:42:30] And it makes it very easy to wire your Haskell code onto off-chain infrastructure. So, you know, in the future, you'll be able to have your off-chain running node or the Java virtual machine or a Don head application. And they'll just be this beautiful interface. And then it can talk to all your Onshape code that's written in that DSL.

[00:42:45] And you have a high degree of assurance that it's, uh, that it's right. Is there, um, like a hello world program and Plutus that reveals the beauty of the, this balance that you're referring to sort of a simple, but not too simple. Einstein. Yeah. Yeah. So we did do our first hello world program actually today because we had heard about this.

[00:43:04] Yeah. Um, but you know, there you'd want to have the whole round trip, so you'd like to have an interaction. And I think a video game would probably show it the best. Like if we could reimplement crypto kitties or something like that on it, and you have the soft chain infrastructure and you have your glue and your front end, it's running on your phone or a browser.

[00:43:21] And most of that lives off chain. And then, but your crypto kitties they'd live on the blockchain, the whole round trip end-to-end with relatively low fees and low latency and, uh, and high availability of service. It never goes down. Uh, that would probably be the best thing to do. And we'll have something like that by August.

[00:43:37] It's pretty easy to build this. So what kind of off-chain interactions are supportive with Plutus? What are the limits, do you want to put on the thing? So it doesn't get chaotic. That's the beautiful thing. When you have a less expressive model on chain, it means you can do anything you want off Chinese.

[00:43:50] Uh, so you started talking about smart contracts, but, uh, let's zoom back out and ask, uh, the big question here is what is a blockchain and what is a cryptocurrency? So a blockchain is just a ledger and really it has three nice properties, your timestamped, your immutable, and audit-able either in a global or local sense.

[00:44:10] And so there's all kinds of things. Mankind has invented where it's really important that you, when you put some information down, it doesn't change and other people can see it. Uh, and that, you know, when it was put down, for example, a property ledger. So when you buy a land or you have rights associated with land, like mineral rights or water rights, or these things you'd like to, transitively see, how does it go from Alice to Bob, to Charlie, to Jim and so forth.

[00:44:36] And, uh, what was the state of these things as they were transitioning? So how much did they pay, uh, you know, when did it occur, et cetera, et cetera. The metadata that follows that. Okay, well, normally these types of ledgers are so important that they're managed either by governments or regulated entities and the issues are that while they can be efficient, they're generally.

[00:44:57] The political manipulation and they're brittle to geopolitical events. For example, when Syria fell apart, you know, the very first thing ISIS did is they started saying, Hey, the ownership of the land, it's going to fundamentally change. We've decided that, you know, this guy over here now owns all these things.

[00:45:13] And then when peace comes, like, how do you unwind all of that? Put it all back together. Uh, so the, the power of a blockchain is that it gives you a transnational way of sorting all these details out, putting all together in, in, in, in a place that you know, that even if it's inconvenient to a very powerful actor, that it will still stay preserved.

[00:45:35] This is a, an, a cemetery we haven't had as a society, usually Kings and empires. They have the ability to decide what's true. Uh, and then suddenly you have this asymmetrical thing that is above them, kind of like a synthetic laws of physics. And once something goes in there, you know, that that's there.

[00:45:52] Okay. So that's the first part of it. The second part of it is that it's auditable, meaning that instead of saying only the high cleric or the president, or, you know, some very special club of people get to see what's going on. Suddenly now all the people can actually see who owns what, where like imagine a tax system where, you know, the ProPublica just leaked, um, the, the taxes of all these different billionaires and said, well, how should they make and how should they pay?

[00:46:21] W w mentioned a tax system where that's just done by. Or any other social systems where this type of information is put in by default. So a it's tremendously useful, uh, this type of structure and all kinds of things, medical records, supply chains, you know, just a thought experiment is I travel a lot of into 52 countries in the last five years.

[00:46:41] Imagine if I got sick and Zimbabwe, you know, I hit by a car or something and I'm unconscious and is involved with when a doctor calls my doctor in Colorado and says, Hey, you know, I need all Charles has medical records. Uh, you know, he's unconscious right now. Uh, but I needed to treat him because he's quite ill.

[00:46:56] Uh, they'd say, who is this person is Zimbabwe. W w I don't know you, I can't give you his records. I need his consent. Oh, no, he's unconscious. And the hospital can't do it. Well, a broker system that would allow the movement of medical records would be an example of what a blockchain could potentially do in the foreseeable future.

[00:47:10] Cryptocurrency is just an application that runs a top blockchain, because it just turns out that when you issue property, you also can issue tokens of value. And then you could have a monetary policy. It can be inflationary or deflationary and Demarius where it decays over time or whatever have you, uh, and the very same mechanics that would ensure your property records are secure.

[00:47:31] Your medical record access to secure could also be applied for the ownership of the cryptocurrency. And again, you can either be completely transparent and everybody can see what everybody owns, and that's what Bitcoin does. Or you can be as OPEC as you seek to be. That's what Z cash basically attempts to do.

[00:47:46] It says, Hey, let's keep these things as private as possible, but they have relatively the same mechanics in terms of those properties of auditability and timestamping and immutability, you know, things won't be reversed. You know, that people aren't going to manipulate the timestamps and, uh, you can audit at least enough to know that the ownership is right, but the way, if you think about physics and the universe, the universe has figured out a way to update the ledger of physics in a way where like a lot of people can be updating it and it's stays consistent.

[00:48:16] Is there, um, is there something you can say about the task of updating the ledger? When a bunch of people are trying to do it, or a bunch of entities are trying to do it, that's the whole point of a consensus algorithm. So whatever ledger you're running, there has to be some mechanism to decide who's in charge.

[00:48:32] And that's what proof of work does, and proof of stake does and all these other systems, and you break them down at basically three steps. And so we'll use Eve for kind of step number one. Hi, Eve, how you doing? And we're going to use Wally for step number two, and I need the monkey gave me the monkey.

[00:48:47] What's the monkey's name? Uh, Daisy. Daisy. The monkey. Okay. I like days. This is a very confused monkey ponder. It's pondering its own mortality just right. And so anyway, the first step is it's all about basically deciding who's in charge for that moment. So blockchain is just a sequence of events. The heart has to beat the metronome has to click.

[00:49:08] So somebody has to be in charge. And so generally you have this notion of a resource. So there's some pool of resource out there and it can be a token. And in that case, it's a Politico cratic system. And that's what proof of stake does or can be computation, but there can be other resources, but computations, but proof of work does.

[00:49:23] And so you make so many hashes and then eventually somebody wins. And that person who wins is now the person who basically gets to decide the order of transactions and put them all together from their perspective in the system. Then once that person wins, they'll make the block that's step two. And after it's made transmitted and it gets validated and accepted.

[00:49:43] So actually it's quite fortuitous. You have the magnifying glass because at this stage, people are trying to decide is what I'm looking at, correct or not. Now there are other ways to potentially conceive of this, but this particular model gives you a kind of a way of thinking of, uh, all consensus algorithms.

[00:50:01] In one setting, you can be Al grand. You can be a classic PFT protocol. You can be Paxos, you can be raft, you can be proof of work. You can be proof of stake. It's always the same idea. Uh, you have to find someone or some group to be in charge, they'll reach a consensus on order. They have to then do some work, change the state of the system updated.

[00:50:23] And then the network has to accept that that's valid. So even if this process works well, this side will say, oh, you created a Bitcoin out of thin air. You're not allowed to do that. So that's rejected. Okay. So there's checks and balances and guards all the way through. There's a meta question of fairness in all of this.

[00:50:39] Okay? So the proof of work people, they're kind of a cult and they say that this is the only truth and everything out here, any other resources, not legitimate or valid. And there's not a lot of evidence to that, but that's what they believe. The proof of stake people, the downside and weakness they have is it's a plutocratic model.

[00:50:57] The more ownership of the system you have, the more control you have over that system. And it suffers from the same thing the shareholder model suffer from. Whereas you may maximize short-term gain over the longterm viability of the system. So a really cool question is can you build systems that are multi resource?

[00:51:14] So instead of just pulling from one resource to select who wins. This 25% of the time, and maybe this 25%, you can do that. In fact, uh, the cryptocurrency space did that a long time ago. There was a cryptocurrency called pure coin in 2011, and it was a hybrid proof of work, proof of stake. So some of the blocks were made with the token ownership distribution, and some of the blocks were made was proof of work, but you could keep adding, you could put in like, Hey, I want hard disk in my thinking you put PERMA coin in or something like that.

[00:51:43] So it create incentive for hard drives. And then you can say, oh no, I want to do like a human system, like a proof of merit. Oh my God. Now we're up to four and you just keep adding. And each of these pools will have different adherence and actors, and then you can actually balance out the whole thing. So as opposed to having one call, do you have million calls actually?

[00:52:00] And they argue, and the Colts argue with each other and we call that a government, by the way, not all called to bed. Physics is a cult too, and it's sometimes bad. It's honest, at least nature. Yes, nature is metal. It's got the Instagram. That's really the crux of it. You do, you have a ledger and the, and the ledger is just all about saying, Hey, we need to put some stuff in here.

[00:52:21] And once it's put in here, you can't turn it back. And, uh, you know, when it was put in and everybody can see it, or some group can see it, and then you need to pick somebody to modify that. So all this chaos will happen. All these transactions are all around the world and our perception of them are different.

[00:52:37] There's a beautiful paper from Lamport that kind of talks about this from the seventies. It's like one of the most classic papers ever in computer science. I think it has been cited like 50,000 times or something like that. It's crazy paper, but basically you have to figure out, okay, well, somebody has to be in charge.

[00:52:51] Some group has to be in charge and you can do it with a meritocratic hash autocratic computation thing. You can say, well, if you have coins 25, 20 5% of supply, 25% of the time on average, you'll be selected to have the right to do this, or give it to somebody else. Or you could search for other resources and they can even be human resources, like some notion of merit or social benefit.

[00:53:12] Maybe you get a token for that and you can weight it with these other systems. And that's where, kind of where everything's going. You know, we're getting to a point where we've really optimized all the properties here. We've proven all these nice things about it. And there's a lot of competition to, to basically build like the perfect proof of stake system, whether you're a polka dot or Al grant or any of these other guys, but now the next step is say, well, why don't we just have one?

[00:53:36] We should have multiple resources. And the point is, each of these has different trade-off profiles. And so they balance each other and you end up building a much more resilient system. So it's not winner take all with one particular demand. Okay. So there's a million questions that spring up right there.

[00:53:52] The first link on this topic and say, what is proof of work? What is proof of stake? Just zooming in on each of those and what are the differences. Okay. So they all have the same three properties of pick someone in charge, do something and validate it. The difference is that the picking mechanism for proof of work is you have to solve a puzzle.

[00:54:11] So it's basically like buying lottery tickets and you can buy a certain amount every second with your computing devices. And some of them are async resistance that you run them on like a laptop or a GPU. And some of them are you specialized hardware that you have to either manufacturer or buy from someone who sells it to you.

[00:54:28] And that's just how many tickets per second you can get. And eventually you hit those magic numbers. And when you do it means you have the right to make the block. And generally you bundle the block making with the proof of work system. Now you can do this looking for a single. Or you can do this to actually Charlotte and look for multiple block makers at the same time.

[00:54:47] So there are sharded proof of work protocols, like prism is an example of that. And, uh, uh, actually Ethereum got started this way with specter and, and coast and Phantom, the work and you a ton of some Lapinski. But the basic idea is you pick some collection of people. They make some collection and things, and there's some way to sort it all out, serialize it and prevent double spends great proof of stake is the same, but it's a synthetic resource.

[00:55:11] So instead of doing things, they say, well, if you had 25% of the hash power on average, over a long period of time, you'd probably win 25% of the time. Well, why don't we just introduce some random as sin from some source and then 25% of the time on average, over a long period of time, you'll win. So it's a synthetic resource, uh, but you still have to do the other two things.

[00:55:30] You still have to make the block and you still have to validate the block. The big difference is this step in the proof of work world is horrendously expensive. You use more energy than the nation of Switzerland. And the problem with that is that you have less resources for the other two. And the other problem with that is that if this is horrendously expensive, you have an economy of scale kick at.

[00:55:50] So what ends up happening is the system becomes less decentralized over time because you have these vertically integrated operations. I mean, not everybody can go build a mining facility on a volcano in El Salvador. Not everybody can go to Mongolia and set up a five gigawatt power plant and a huge data thing.

[00:56:06] Not everybody has access to the patent today, six that people produce, because what if I don't sell it to you? And I have the patent on it, or what if I control the supply chain for these things? So you'll end up having centralization around maybe 10 or five major operations as we've seen historically with proof of work and.

[00:56:24] It means you end up having a ruling class of a mining oligarchy in the system, proof of stake. If you design the parameters correctly, you actually get more decentralized over time. Because as the currency goes up in value, the distribution of the currency tends to get more, more egalitarian. As for example, bill gates, when he started Microsoft, he had 64% of the shares.

[00:56:47] Now he has less than 5% of the shares. So there's founder drift over time. As the value goes up, divestment occurs, you have more and more and more people coming in. That means there's more people who can participate in the consensus and you can even tune economic parameters. And this is what we did with, uh, Cardona and or Boris.

[00:57:03] We, we created this concept of K in the system and it's just a parameter. And it's, it's like a forcing factor that tends to accumulate a certain amount of state pool. So you can set it to 200 and 500 and a thousand and so forth. But the basic idea is, as the price of ADA goes up, you make K larger. And then you end up in practical terms, having a larger and larger set of actors, making blocks that are unique and distinct.

[00:57:28] And the other good thing is this is a virtual resource instead of a physical resource, which means it's portable by the click of a button. So let's say China says, mining is bad. We're going to shut it all down. And it looks like they're moving in that direction. You have all these people in. We-chat just like trying to sell miners.

[00:57:44] They're trying to figure out how the hell do I move miners? You know? Cause they have these huge data centers they've constructed. You can't exactly go and grab a server and like take it with it's huge. It's a lot of work. And if the government seizes it well, it's their property. Now a virtual resource, you can click a button and redeploy it to a different jurisdiction.

[00:58:00] So to me, for a virtual asset, it makes a lot more sense to try to tie your security to something indogenous something within the system, because it's, it's just like the asset. It can move anywhere at a click of a button and human beings have a much harder time attacking something like that. Well, so people, maybe you could sort of play devil's advocate and say, what is the strength of proof of work system?

[00:58:21] Because some people would argue that proof of work has because it's outside the system. Uh, it's tied to physical resources. It's more secure, it's less prone to, um, By large groups of people. Yeah, that's a great question. And the first question we had was could proof of stake actually work or not. So the problem was that the engineer kind of led when the science should have led.

[00:58:46] And so there were all these POS protocols that came out in the early 2010s, like impure coin was the first and the NXT and others came out and there, they had suffered from. The random number generation wasn't good at grinding attacks and nothing had steak and all these other things. And there's a lot of beautiful properties for proof of work.

[00:59:03] From a theoretical sense. We even wrote a paper called , uh, named after the authors, Juan Gray, uh, Nicoli Aaron artists and egoless Cassis, our chief scientist. He's got 1100 citations now and it's, you know, it was published in 2015, but basically all it did is just modeled a blockchain and created some security properties for it.

[00:59:21] And then it started talking about, well, what does proof of work actually do for you? And it turns out it does a lot. It's an asynchronous system. You can bootstrap from Genesis. So if Eve joins the network and Wally joins the network and Daisy joined the network, then you give them some different chains, like five or 10 different chains.

[00:59:41] They can run a calculation and they will always pick the longest chain, the heaviest chain inside the system. That's a great property of proof of work until we published our board Genesis in 2018. Uh, you actually needed to solve that and proof of stake with a trusted checkpoint. So some actor had to be observing, watching the whole thing and creating checkpoints.

[01:00:00] And then when new people joined in, they would only be able to distinguish between a chain based upon a checkpoint telling them that. So you have to do a lot of really wonky, crazy math to show the crit, this notion of like density to be able to show that that's possible, but there's a lot of properties of proof of work that were super hard to replicate and emulate.

[01:00:19] And the proof of stake world, uh, Macaulay kind of revolutionized the whole VRF thing. Uh, uh, there was a group out of Cornell that talked about better network conditions. They wrote a paper called sleepy. Uh, we did Genesis. Uh, we also did the very first privileged secure protocol, but that was six years of work and like 12 papers.

[01:00:37] And it's still not done. There's still a few polishing things that have to be cleaned up because, you know, it's, it's, this is a physical resource and there's, there's something there, but there's a flaw to proof of work that is a little problematic. It's a winner take all type of a system. So maximalism is kind of philosophically and computationally built into it.

[01:00:56] Let's say you have two proof of work systems and they have roughly the same market cap and hash rate and they use the same algorithm. Then the problem is if the miner comes in and let's say the minor has enough resources to have 51%, uh, for any of these chains, they actually have a perverse incentive to.

[01:01:15] And destroy one chain and short sell the asset. It's called a gold finger attack and then go mine the other asset. Cause they're not bound to that asset. They're not loyal to it. And they can make just as much profit mining this as they can make mining the other system and the markets allow them to profit from the destruction of a system.

[01:01:35] So that's something that proof of stake doesn't suffer from because the only way you can participate in a proof of stake system is you have to actually own equity and you have to have ownership in that system. So if you go and destroy daisies chain, uh, they, uh, it would just be a net loss for the most part, unless you have really messed up markets or something like that.

[01:01:53] So there's always trade offs and all these things. And this is why I like this concept of going one to end and having multiple resources, because why not have proof of work and proof of stake together. If the proof of work is useful, not wasted computation and why not add other things like create incentives for network relay right now there's no incentives in the system for you to run peer to peer nodes and the shared data right now, it's not a problem, but if you're running like Amazon web services level of bandwidth, it could cost you like $5,000 a month in bandwidth just to run a full node or something like that.

[01:02:21] No one would do it. So then your system will centralize along the weakest link, whether it be the storage layer, the computation layer, or the network layer of the system. So if you can incentivize the resources differently, then you'll be in a beautiful position where, uh, you, you end up having a resilient system that pays its own bills.

[01:02:39] So how does Cardona solve the consensus problem? Do you tend to eventually wanting to solve it in the hybrid approach of proof of stake and proof of work? Yeah. This was the philosophical difference between metallic and myself, you know, the problem with the people in the theater. So it was a really bright and these really bright people, what they do is they try to do everything all at once because they're really, really smart and they keep going until they run up against the wall and they realize the problem is a lot harder if you're more experienced.

[01:03:09] And that's why we brought in proper academics like analysts and others. Cause they they'd been beaten up through life. You know, Anglos works with David CHOGM and these other, this really hard work with those guys and they'd already been humiliated and yelled at, had chalk thrown out of it, all that stuff.

[01:03:24] And so they were humble enough to say I'm not smart enough to solve the big. So don't even try what you do is you decompose it and you say, okay, what's the first problem to solve in a chain of problems that you can compose your way up to a working system. And once you get far enough along, you have something that's pretty good.

[01:03:41] And then you have an obvious path forward of how do you iterate and improve that system. That's why we start with G kale 15, because it was just saying we don't know what it would have fucking blocks. Hm, this, this is what is this thing, right? What's the security properties, this stuff like what, what do we really mean?

[01:03:55] Then we did our Boris classic, the original workforce protocol in 2017. And that protocol was like a synchronous system and it assumed the nodes were always on and it worked, but it was useless because that's not real life. Then prowess came out and then suddenly we relaxed things. These are all by the way, news for consensus algorithm that we published, then they're all peer reviewed.

[01:04:15] Like GK was Euro crypt. That's a very hard conference to get into an wars. Classic was crypto and Prouse was zero crypt and, uh, Genesis was CCS. So, uh, basically every step of the way was first academic validation that there were some merit to the work that was done. Second, it solved a particular class of problems, either showing the feasibility of the entire problem.

[01:04:36] Cause when I said, well, let's do the model first. Cause let's see if we can do an FLP thing. Let's see if we can get them possibility theorem. That's great. Cause you're done. It's like, you know, those, those short math papers were like, I found a counterexample. It's like, oh, okay. This whole thing is falling apart.

[01:04:49] Cause you, you have a two line proof. Thank you. Uh, so that's what we were looking for in the beginning of the agenda was let's either prove it's possible in a straw man case or show that there existed a possibility result, which case we can just abandon the entire inquiry proof of stakes impossible.

[01:05:04] And then once you've gotten past that threshold, it goes from theory to practicality. What actual network conditions are you looking at? Are you okay with living with an external clock or do you want to build time from within how are you generating random numbers, et cetera, et cetera. And every step of the way each paper you're solving one particular class of problems with prism, it said probably shouldn't know ahead of time who Eve is, uh, you know, you probably shouldn't know who's making those blocks.

[01:05:28] That should be something, you know, after the fact. But if you know ahead of time you can attack them. You can DDoSs them, you cause all kinds of problems. Okay. So, you know, adaptive security also, we move from an MPC, random number generation, which was great, but very heavy and very slow. And you can't scale to large amounts of people to a VRF based system, which is super fast, but a little dirtier because Al grant actually did some great work there, there was some good knowledge there.

[01:05:53] What are the really hard problems that you, maybe you just linger a little bit? What are some of the really hard problems you have to solve along this chain of papers, ideas, the evolution of the consensus algorithm. Yeah. It's not only are they really hard problems. They actually require different cryptographers because you're moving from mathematics.

[01:06:09] Style cryptographers like the Neil copilots is and the Eddy Shamirs and other people that like start as proper mathematicians and they really love theory and that's their thing. And the proofs are dense and they're thick and they're beautiful to practical applied work where you're saying, okay, now this is something an engineer can look at and say, I know how to build that.

[01:06:28] I know how to think about that. So that transition from G kale or porous classic to Prouse the, I'd say the biggest leap was classic depress because that was going from a system that would only work in a consortium chain, like fabric to a system that would actually work and is working that's what's implementing Cartano today, you know, $50 billion cryptocurrency and all these people.

[01:06:50] That was a huge leap, but that paper alone wasn't enough. We also had to layer on the economic model because we said, well, hang on a second here. And not, everybody's going to be online all the time to, to be available, to make a block. So you need some notion of delegation, the mini, you have notion of delegation, you have these stake pools.

[01:07:07] What the hell does that mean? Uh, and so this is a beautiful kind of interdisciplinary notion that layers, computer science and biology together, and minute, that complexity starts going up. You start seeing sales specialists. So you go from single cell organisms to organisms where you have eyeballs and brains and hearts, and each of these tissues do different things.

[01:07:28] Well, analogously complex distributed systems start getting specialization. You move from the single cell thing, Bitcoin where everything's a full, no, they all have the same rights and responsibilities, a lot of homogeneity in that system, but you're only as good as your weakest link. You're only, you're only as capable as whatever the basic cell can do to a specialized system where you start having these actors in the system that are actually a little different than the other actors.

[01:07:51] So you introduce this concept of the stake pool, and suddenly now you have this actor where you're probably going to be online 24 7. You're probably going to have extra relay infrastructure. There's a trust relationship where you don't own the ADA, but you have right to use it for something. And a person's made that choice to endow you with that.

[01:08:08] The minute that you introduce specialization, though, the system gets more complicated. The game theory gets more complicated and then you start having to think really deeply and carefully about, okay. Can this now introduce a new attack vector that we didn't have before. So that leap from classic to Prouse and adding in state pools and figuring out how to handle the game theory.

[01:08:27] There was exceedingly hard two years to do that. Just take pools, allows for multiple parties to delegate their staking capabilities to others. Can you describe a little bit how this works? It's kind of fascinating. It's a super simple concept. So you register a pool and then the pool is there and they're basically, they advertise and they're actually registered on chain, was a certificate.

[01:08:48] And then in the wallet software itself, you can see all of the pools that have registered. There's over 3000 of them now inside the system, and you can click a little tile and it shows you all the metadata that's in the certificate and says, Hey, you know, I have my own pool. It's called rats, you know, king of the rats.

[01:09:04] Uh, so you can see all the stuff that's described there and pools have an operating feet, cause they're like a business. And they say, well, if you delegate to me, uh, I'll charge this much. So if you get like a hundred bucks in rewards, I'll give you 90 and I'll take 10 or something like that. Uh, and then you make your decision and whichever one, you select, you click, you know, delegate, push the button and then you have now given your staking rights to them until revoked.

[01:09:29] Okay. So it lives there. And then, uh, the state pools weight in the system is proportional to the. Steak that they have delegated to them. And then we have this other limiting factor K, which says that you get diminishing returns with the more steak you have. So it's kind of like an S function. So you kind of go up and up and, and then eventually caps.

[01:09:46] And then at some point you get no rewards beyond a certain threshold. So there's an incentive to split pools, to different owners after some point. Yeah. And so, so that's a complex thing and you have to actually model the game theory out to understand where those parameters should be set. And we didn't know how to do that.

[01:10:02] So what we did is we, we bought talent. We went to Oxford and we hired this guy named Alyeska supers. He's an algorithmic game theorist. We said, Hey, would you like to do some game theory work in crypto? And he's like, that sounds fun. So he spent a year and a half, we built all these beautiful models and we kind of figured out what those curves needed.

[01:10:18] We'll figure it out like the S-curve that would result in a nice distribution. Exactly what responsibility. So not everybody, uh, delegates to the king of the rats. Exactly. How's it feel to be royalty by the way? It's not a very impressive kingdom, but you nevertheless a king take it. Cause I think it's the kindest thing.

[01:10:35] People call me in this space. Uh, yeah. People love you. So, okay, so that, I mean, so is that, would you say a solved problem, the game theory of stake pools? No. It's um, the starting and that I was getting back to my original point of that. You build things in iterations. Every step, if you've done it right, is an invitation for 10 more sexy faceting fun problems.

[01:10:56] And this is why we have such a great time building labs. You know, we started in Edinburgh now we're at Tokyo tech and university of Wyoming and Athens, and we're setting up more labs this year and all these academics want to work with us. Hey, cause we write a lot of really fascinating papers, but B because we're focused on all these really cool, sexy, interdisciplinary problems, we're actually running the problems where we don't even know where the published the paper.

[01:11:17] Cause you'll have this paper where there's like these PL guys working with crypto guys, working with systems, guys, working with economists and you put all together and you have this Frankenstein paper monster. And we're like, where do we submit this? You know, where does this go? Nature? Yeah, there we go.

[01:11:30] Nature Quanta or something. I don't know. They'll run a nice to the sexy problems, multiply exponentially. Exactly. And you know, and we've now gotten to a point where we're starting to work on refinements to the system rather than. Fundamental things that are like, if you don't solve it, the system just simply doesn't work.

[01:11:47] For example, you can run all of this with NTP as your clock server, but you actually can create a notion of time within, we wrote a paper called the workforce Kronos for that. Okay. But that's not necessary for the system. It's just a nice to have thing. It's a nice property optimization. And the random number generation is another example of that.

[01:12:03] You can run it with a heavier thing. You just have more blockchain, bloat and slower time in transition. We have this concept of an epic. So you elect leaders to run the system, uh, every five days with Cardinal, but there's been derivative work. We didn't even do this. This work occurred at university of Illinois and that derivative works at well.

[01:12:21] You don't actually need to do that. You can do it on a block by block basis. It's like, Ooh, that's pretty cool. Uh, so that's the other point about doing things in a very rigorous way is that that way is creates a lingual franca for what you're trying to solve with the totality of the academic community.

[01:12:36] So suddenly people that you've never met, you know, nothing about have read your papers, cited your papers, and start writing their own papers either to try to attack and destroy things you've done or to build on top of the things that you've gotcha. So people are trying to figure out ways to attack this exactly rigorous as, as rigorous as you are trying to protect them.

[01:12:54] That's the beautiful thing. It's fun. It's fun to try to destroy. And that's how we grow stronger. This is how you build your career too. There's there's plenty of people that they've gotten tenured. Just kicking the hell out of Intel SGX. You go to CCS every year. There's some guy there and he's having a hell of a time making Intel cry.

[01:13:11] Can we pull back historically speaking? And in terms of the big picture of cryptocurrency real quick and ask the question, what is Cardona? We started talking about already the consensus algorithm and Cardinal takes, but maybe when you look at the history books, you know, sort of a Hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy and Cardona, we'll have one sentence, oh, what's that one sentence going to be?

[01:13:33] And in general, what's like the vision in the context of the history of cryptocurrency, you have like this white board overview video, they, you talk about the three generations of cryptocurrency where Kadana is the third. So that's a. Like five different questions way of asking the exact same thing you can answer.

[01:13:49] How are the hell you want? You know, Cari, I always termed Cordato is like a FOS, a financial operating system, and nobody likes it. And everybody picks on me for using that term. But basically the idea is that, you know, the world runs on systems and especially the financial world, you have, you know, the BIS and swift and all this other stuff.

[01:14:07] And , and these protocols allow you to move value around and represent things like identity and, uh, and allow you to express yourself in some way. And those protocols for the most part work well for people in rich countries and they don't work so well for people who aren't enrich countries. And so the point of what we do, or at least what I do and what my company does is we think a lot about how do we build a universal protocol that does all the stuff that legacy system has, but just does it better, faster, and cheaper for everybody in the world.

[01:14:40] And everybody has equal access to it. You know? So it's the people's protocol. You know, you have a situation where the guy in Senegal has the same access that I do or does, or someone else who's kind of higher on the spectrum of wealth and power. And so, uh, that is what we seek to achieve. But then the question is will, is Cardinal the solution, you know, is it, that, is that, that thing?

[01:15:01] And the answer is no, because the, you need a lot more evolution. You need decades of evolution to kind of work your way through. And in many ways, the work has never quite done, but it's better than what came before. Why? Because you, you have a realization that first the control of the system needs to be more balanced and nuanced and it needs to be more democratic.

[01:15:23] So there's this sustainability component of what who's in charge and how do you pay for things? Well, the system can print its own money, so it always has the ability to have a budget. Okay. So there's a treasury idea. And then there's a voting thing. Well, the same things that allow you to move money around, allow you to represent votes.

[01:15:39] So you can do e-voting with the type of system. Okay. And you know, if you played no mic in the 1980s or Peter super-fan or any of these things, you can build a self evolving system. You can actually create a game where the rules can be voted on and change in the game itself. Great. Okay. So that exists there and then you say, okay, well, but this thing still has to touch the legacy world.

[01:15:59] There has to be cash in and cash out and these types of things. So there's this, this interoperability thing, you need a wifi or Bluetooth moment for the industry because nothing understands each other. Right now, there are all these chains are blind, deaf, and dumb to each other. And then there's this thing that it has to work at a huge scale, like billions of people.

[01:16:15] And we've done that, but we've done that with large multinational trillion dollar companies with centralized infrastructure. We've never really done that with one master protocol that somehow does it for everyone. The closest approximation is probably a bit torrent and there's, you know, there was, it's a cool protocol, but it doesn't have all the necessary to necessary to do something like this.

[01:16:36] So Cardona was just our first approximation and like any good system it's we wanted it to be self evolving. So once you get the philosophy out of where's the target of what do you want to do? Then you build a community. Now it's over a million people strong, and that community keeps growing and they keep pushing the system in that particular direction.

[01:16:54] And what's nice about it. You, if you build the right philosophy within the system, it doesn't need founders. This is the great lesson of sotoshi. It doesn't need founders to be able to get there. So, uh, you know, if you look at the academic side, that's very decentralized. We have more than 30 different contributors for the 105 papers.

[01:17:13] And that set keeps growing within the next five years. We'll probably be 2, 3, 400 different scientists from all across the world. Some from Russia and some from India, some from China and some from Japan and America and Africa and south America, and the faces change, the language has changed. The culture has changed, but the process stays the same.

[01:17:32] And that is a permanent. Within what we have constructed as a system, it's the same situation entering marketplaces. Like we entered Ethiopia, what are we doing there? We have 5 million people in Ethiopia. We're getting them digital identity. And we're dragging that digital identity into the system because that's the most fundamental thing of a financial operating system.

[01:17:50] You need to know who people are in order to be able to do business with them, give them credit, be able to give them economic agency and sort of thing. But once they're there, they're going to grow up with that system. They're going to deploy applications on that system. They're going to build on that system or use it every day for getting a loan or payments and so forth.

[01:18:06] And if they have pain points, what they're going to do is evolve that system to be able to mitigate, manage those particular pain points to a point where the system is competitive for it. So my job is to be, we have this tagline on our company, cascading disruption. Our, my job is to be the first domino, just kind of knock it over and watch the cascade.

[01:18:26] And it kind of blows and blows up, blows up until eventually, uh, you know, it gets to where we need to go. And what I was trying to think about with Cardona Dano was how do you build the minimum viable. Of tools and social processes that once we push the domino, the system will just evolve to a point where eventually you can grow to fill that need not out of charity, but out of self-interest people want things better, faster, cheaper.

[01:18:51] You know, people want to have economic agency, especially when they lack it. Nobody wants to grow up in a world where they're unbanked and they have no access to marketplaces. They're going to seek it, look at M-Pesa is the great example of that like cell phone minutes they're using as a currency. So, uh, that's where we're at.

[01:19:09] And I save a few more years. I think we'll have that right. Minimum viable set of dynamics inside the system. And then it's inevitable in my view that it will kind of grow and consuming, become this concept. And what's really cool is there's competition in the systems and concepts. So China's trying to do the same thing.

[01:19:24] They're saying, how do we dollarize the world and create a digital Yuan. So they have a very top down notion of how to apply this technology and bring it in. And they even have an identity system they're building in parallel called social credit. We have an identity system, a taller prism that we're putting in ours is bottom up and you own your own identity, social credit.

[01:19:40] You have no idea. You just have a number in some computers giving it to you, but they're both trying to do the exact same thing. And it's going to be this clash of cultures at some point between the open forces and the top-down authoritarian fosters and probably some high galleon dialectic action. You know, some sort of somewhat close, somewhat authoritarian, libertarian utopia.

[01:20:02] Yeah. Almost like it would be AIS battling in the space of faucet. So I really liked this idea of financial operating system, but what this, the letter F so financial, is this just, um, a basic mechanism with which you can have social interaction. There are therefore all kinds of interactions. Therefore having an identity, like is F essential to this.

[01:20:26] Yeah. Because that's how people care. You need resources to survive. And, you know, finances is kind of like this field of, of managing your resources and an intelligent way, and you could call it so Phi to social finance, you know, the, the, the nomenclature hasn't exactly been settled for our industry. And that's fun.

[01:20:44] But basically the concept is that you, you, you have something and you want to be able to store it, transform it, trade it, and use it to survive. Uh, and the question is, what rails do you do that on? Do you do those on centralized controlled rails? Where there are these third parties that are, you know, basically able to live off those things come very fat nepotistic, or do you want to do it on rails where there's no middleman, you have a direct relationship with whoever you're doing business.

[01:21:11] And if you invite more people into the transaction, they're middlemen of value, not necessity. And that's really the, I would like to say the resin Dettra of our space, that the reason we exist is to try to figure out a way to kill the middleman and try to figure out a way that we can better quantify value and transform it, move it, manipulate it.

[01:21:28] And in many ways we've actually discovered some amazing things in the last 10 years as an industry, like we've kind of created the financial stem cell. This idea of a token can now is just as well be a national currency as a CBDC, as it can represent a crypto kitty, you know, the same architecture can do stuff at the nation scale can do stuff for a 12 year old kid in Texas.

[01:21:48] It's pretty amazing to see that, but sort of in that whiteboard presentation, Gave these three phases and you kind of implying that there'll be and phases to do this whole evolution. And Cardona is just like the cutting edge. But if you look back to, um, to Bitcoin, how would you compare Cardinal versus Bitcoin, sort of where we are, uh, how we started and how.

[01:22:16] Okay. So what I did in that video, and I've done a lot of media interviews because I think it really helps people understand where we're at in the clock is, is free face things in terms of generations. And so I said, well, the first generation is Bitcoin. And really the problem Bitcoin was trying to solve the thing.

[01:22:32] Every time we want to represent our move value, we need some sort of trusted third party to facilitate that. So can we build some sort of system where we can create some notion of value that can be teleported around the world? And it doesn't require a trusted third party, that's it? And it's done in a beautiful way because it didn't try to be anything else.

[01:22:52] It just was, you only have Bitcoin, you can only do one type of thing. You can only push it. You can do some things on the encumbrances of like, you know, multisig and other things. But this is a one trick pony as a system. And it wasn't really clear if that was going to work or not. For a long time, it took several years to build up enough network effect and for Bitcoins to actually become valuable.

[01:23:12] And I'd say the inflection point was 2013. And at that point it became a billion dollar market cap. There were like Silicon valley startups, uh, real exchanges performing. And it got to a point where there was legitimacy behind the concept and people started getting, this is a really incredible idea because I can a capital controls with it.

[01:23:29] I can like move $10 billion of something from one country to another country in five minutes. It's like, I could never do that before. And you know, some cities, this is incredible. Okay. The problem is the minute that people validate the idea, uh, they, they immediately want something they don't have. So like the minute Elan can land a rocket, you know, there's the next big thing, right?

[01:23:50] You've landed the Falcon nine. Now you're on the star ship. Similarly, you say, okay, I want programmability with this thing. It's kind of like when JavaScript came to the web browser, you went from these static, perhaps pretty, but ultimately static non-interactive pages to YouTube and Google and Facebook and these amazing rich, incredible experiences.

[01:24:10] Because now you can actually interact with the user. You can program things, stuff runs on their sides, stuff comes in your side. It's a beautiful two-way relationship. So that's what a theorem effectively did. They bolted a programming language onto a blockchain and they went from. And use case to whatever your imagination can have, you know, like sunshine and rainbows and unicorns and these types of things.

[01:24:33] So I think Bitcoin is HTML and Ethereum is JavaScript, basically. Yeah, it was like when JavaScript came and with like JavaScript, it has all kinds of problems and issues. I wonder who's flashing this analogy metaphor, but that's not good. Well, actually there were plenty of active Xs and flashes. NXT was an example of a fail to start.

[01:24:52] And BitShares was another example, though. There were a lot of people who try to add some notion of programmability in, or a different view of how these things should be done. And they, they were not as competitive. A theorem kind of came out at that JavaScript moment. Okay. The minute you have that, then suddenly you have ICO's and defy and STOs and NFT and all these word salads of things.

[01:25:11] And then people start using the get frustrated. Why? Because it's too slow. It's too expensive. It doesn't talk to the things they wanted to talk to. And also it gets too big to manage itself. When you're small, you have founders and foundations and you have trusted actors in core developers, and you can feed them with pizzas.

[01:25:29] You know them, you can meet them, you can shake their hands at conferences when you're a multi-billion person. You know, you're too large to be able to do that. You know, for example, we had a, the Shelley summit last year, we invited Vince Cerf to come to the summit, fits a brilliant guy. And he had created the internet with Bob and the rest of the gang.

[01:25:49] And, you know, back in those days, it was such a simple small system that, you know, one of their students, they, they said, Hey, you need to test it. It created a video game just to kind of test the thing. And you could call the guy on the other side and say, are you seeing this? Are you getting the signal?

[01:26:01] They used to have an actual address book for email addresses. Yeah. Yeah. So you'd open up the books, look it up and they'll look at the inner it's like, who's in charge of that. It's this gargantuan, uh, you know, network and there's no group of people you can bring in and thus the internet evolves very slowly.

[01:26:18] You see? And so that's the problem is that you have this situation where you want to do lots of utility. You want to do a lot of things. You want to be off on agile operating system and, you know, be everything to everyone. But then your rate of evolution slows down as your rate of adoption speeds up. So the P so that's one of the other design goals of the third generation.

[01:26:35] It's not good enough just to do things better, faster, cheaper, and have consistent costs with your population growing or talk to everything. Your wifi moment. You also need a system that can govern itself at a scale of millions, to billions of people who have divergent interests, some cases, ice pick an eye, divergent interest.

[01:26:52] They really hate each other. And they, uh, they don't get along. And so that's what we termed a third generation cryptocurrency. And there's a lot of people attempting to compete in that space. You know, there's Tezos and Al Gran and ICP and polka dot and so forth. And each and every one of them kind of brings a different blend of things that they value.

[01:27:09] So is it, it's not completely equal between scalability, interoperability, and sustainability. Some people were very focused on high throughput, lots of transactions perspective. Other people very focused on governance like taser ptosis is like the governance chain and they were one of the first to do a self amending ledger.

[01:27:27] And other people are like Ayaan or polka dot. They're really thinking carefully about how do we build a nice interoperable ecosystem with Cardinal. We tried to actually tackle all three at the same time, which was one of the reasons why we were a little slower out of the gate. Uh, we had to write a lot more protocols, but we think we'd kind of come up with a beautiful interlocking design for all of them.

[01:27:46] And again, the point is not to get it perfect, but rather get those just right set of evolutionary factors that when you click the domino, it just self evolves into what you needed to get to allow me. To stretch the metaphor farther. If a Bitcoin is HTML, there's HTML five. If Ethereum is JavaScript, JavaScript with V8 has become quite fast, quite, you know, it runs much of the internet.

[01:28:11] So the, the, the argument could be that eventually everything will be JavaScript, or maybe you could say eventually everything would be HTML. And it just be a bunch of different tools that generate that HTML. So is it possible that, uh, just like Russo, we eventually returned to generation one Bitcoin, or we returned to generation to Ethereum, uh, as we, uh, you know, at the end of this journey, the problem is your tail is wagging the dog there.

[01:28:42] And it's not, you have a situation where you're so focused on the technology that you're failing to understand that there's still Daisy here. You still have the user, and where's the app store. Where's the one-click install. Whereas the using utility, you know, all these layer, two protocols and these defy applications in five years, they're completely protocol and blockchain agnostic because at the end of the day, they care about liquidity operating cost and user experience.

[01:29:07] It's so postrace and absurd for somebody to say, oh, well, I'm going to go build my application, get on the, you know, the apple store. And, uh, I'm going to use Amazon as my web host. And no matter what happens, I will always use Amazon, even if the operating cost is crazy. I see. You see. And so we're just in a unique period of history where there's a network effect around some initial infrastructure and people tend to be building around that, but every single one of the top P D five providers, uh, are, if they're getting successful into a certain network effect, they're having the multi chain conversation.

[01:29:40] So I don't really believe in a winner takes all maximalist view of well, there's going to be some protocol that becomes the God protocol first because they evolve too quickly. Second, the incentives aren't aligned for that TCP IP didn't have a token connected to it. There was no financial incentive, worse TCP IP got adopted over something else that would make some big company, crazy amounts of money.

[01:30:00] It was useful piece of infrastructure. Uh, so I, I think that the third generation is gonna be as defined by the social components and the usability components as it is by the technological capabilities of the system. Really what these technological capabilities gave you, was the ability to demonstrate a proof of concept and say, these things are possible kinda like Xerox park.

[01:30:20] You know, when Steve and bill came in, they said, wow, you have networked computers, object oriented programming, and a good. And this is like, why was it seventies? It's like, wow, this is like incredible. But none of that was an actual product that wasn't a Macintosh, but it was enough to get the idea. And then it was a race to how do we productize something like that.

[01:30:40] And in that case, it actually took several decades to roll out that vision that those guys had. And I think that's what Bitcoin and Ethereum dead, but what's unique about this is normal. You throw away the prior experiments with these things. These are self evolving systems. So it's entirely possible to Joe Rogan quote involve Bitcoin to a point where it could become a third generation system is desired as some amalgamation of layer one and layer two protocols.

[01:31:05] And it's the same for Ethereum. In fact, Vitalik is throwing away Ethereum and replacing with Ethereum too, because he recognizes he needs to upgrade and evolve the system. And that's what makes it fun because the techniques and methodologies that they've chosen to evolve and upgrade this system are distinctly different from the ones that we've chosen.

[01:31:24] And we have no idea which one's actually going to win, but we learn from each other and we co-evolve from each other. So you're running like all these experiments in real time and a giant marketplace, and maybe they'll consolidate, maybe they'll stay divergent. I mean, look at big tech, you have Google, apple, Microsoft, Facebook, they all co-exist.

[01:31:41] And they're trillion dollar companies. Some cases was TCP consolidates to one standard. And that's what we ended up using. So what is your intuition with having the proof of stake and then eventually smart contracts versus the Bitcoin with layer two technologies. That's kind of evolving creature. Again.

[01:32:02] You said you can't really predict the future, but what's your intuition. Why one might be a more successful than the other? So the problem with Bitcoin is it is so slow. It's like the mainframe programming of, of the past. And it's the only reason it's still around is because there was so much invested in keeping it around that and we just kind of have to leave it there.

[01:32:24] And one day COBOL will die. You know, it's, it's a it's it's. There's nothing about it from a collection of USP's that's particularly desirable. You have extremely long settlement time. You have extremely low programmability. It is not aware of any other system. There's no native way of issuing an asset and assistant you can't even do a pull transaction mean you can't do anything that's interesting or unique there.

[01:32:47] And yeah. All due respect, it's, you know, mafia all due respect, you got some problems you need to lose some weight. I know. I know. So, you know, all due respect to the Bitcoin people, it's like an amazing, eh, incredible first-generation thing. And it really we're all here because of Bitcoin. But the problem is you have to upgrade the damn thing, you know, just because you were a high school football star doesn't mean that 30 years later, you're still a high school football star in the same shit.

[01:33:16] You got the beer belly, you're old, you're not doing this thing again. And that's what Bitcoin has to do. There's fundamental improvements that I think Bitcoin can make at the protocol level that would actually make it are incredibly competitive system. Like if they want us to keep Nakamoto consensus, proof of work, there's ways to enhance proof of work.

[01:33:33] I mean, consider did this with Bitcoin NG, a promotive. This Monis did this with a prism, make it 10,000 times faster. And you don't compromise the fundamental security assumptions that the system has. You can add program ability to it. Blockstream critical language called simplicity is so there's, there's actual ways to extend.

[01:33:50] And we did this with Cardona, with the extended UTEC. So model there's ways to extend what Bitcoin has, keep the philosophy, the accounting, the way of thinking about transactions, but then suddenly you can now do defy and other things. But what they've done is said, we will not evolve the base layer at all.

[01:34:06] And we're just going to build all this layer two stuff, which is usually highly fragile and centralized and requires enormous effort at the base level to do anything. There's it's not a coincidence. Vitalik started as a color coins guy and a master coin guy hanging out in those circles. He was trying to innovate and do things in Bitcoin.

[01:34:22] And it was so hard and difficult that he started diverging and going and doing things and a different system entirely. Uh, you know, I knew the Mastercoin guys chair on the, all these people, they were, they were maximalists. They really wanted to build something cool and exciting for Bitcoin and anything they did.

[01:34:37] The developers would attack them and say, oh, you're, you're misusing opera return. You're doing this. That it was a holy war anytime you want it to evolve. So I think it's its own worst enemy. It has the network effect. It has the brand name. It has the regulatory approval. But there's no way to change the system.

[01:34:53] Even correcting obvious downsides in that system. Now what's really cool is the Ethereum doesn't suffer from that problem. It is. It's getting to a point where it has a similar network effect to Bitcoin, but the community there is, is completely different and culture. They love evolving. They love upgrading sometimes a little too much.

[01:35:11] Uh, and so that means that if you look at the trajectory of things, if I had to bet just those two systems Bitcoin or Ethereum, I would say nine times out of 10, Ethereum is going to win the fight against Bitcoin if it was the only competitor, but obviously we're here. And a lot of other people are here.

[01:35:27] So there's different things going on. So it's a much more complex game, but you, I think that's always a key, you know, zooming out a little bit. It's set the technology aside in the word salad of cryptography aside. Cause it's too much. We have to always do is say, what incentive does the system have to evolve?

[01:35:44] And when you look at things like Android and the app store and these analogous platforms, is it, ah, the evolution is user-driven and there's a financial incentive for the user to participate. So if I had to look at the trajectory of this thing, come back 10 years later, it's probably going to have millions of applications and lots of stuff going on because that's the way the system was constructed.

[01:36:04] Okay. It makes sense. When you look at Bitcoin, you say, what is the incentive to evolve the system? There's none. What is the incentive for the system to get more competitive? Not in fact it's the opposite. They've turned it into a religion. I was in Miami at this, this Bitcoin conference there. I had a toilet paper roll thrown at me that had shitcoin written on it.

[01:36:23] You have max Kaiser out on the stage, you know, doing his best. Um, Rick James impression, you know, was he the guy that did the F Elan? Yes, yes, yes. You know, you're, you're watching this stuff and you say, okay, first, why would anybody want to join. And then second, where is the conversation about how do we achieve something?

[01:36:42] I started with Cardona and the end in mind, I said, you know, we really want to sit down and build his financial operating system. And the definition of success is the poorest person in the world has access to the same system as the richest person in the world. And they both get treated fairly. I've never had that happen before.

[01:36:59] Okay. That's something you can agree with it, disagree with it. See, it's boiling the ocean. It's impossible. At least I have something I can't for the life of me. Understand what the hell is the point of Bitcoin. When I joined the Bitcoin space way back in the day, it was, Hey, we hate the dollar. And you know, Hey, we like gold a lot.

[01:37:14] Let's create digital goal. Let's build a payment system. And then it just kind of went all these different directions and nobody can actually tell you what Bitcoin is for. It's a store of value. Okay. You know, if there's some proof of work thing where maybe like incentivizing, uh, alternative energy to be produced don't I don't know.

[01:37:31] It's like, nobody really knows the philosophy. There's no direction. And they say, well, don't worry. Just buy and hold. And everything will sort its way out. I believe it's huddle huddle. What about the idea of digital gold? So try to replace this particular physical material that is gold transfer into the something.

[01:37:50] Okay. Let's do that then. And just say, that's all it does. And why are we doing lightening? Why are we doing any of these other things? Cause you don't really need with, you know, a commodity, a digital commodity high throughput. You can have slow settlement, you can have high transaction fees, all these types of things and, and you know, that's, that's fine.

[01:38:05] Okay. That's something pick it. Well, the idea is, does your church to try to come up with technology like the lightning network that could have something like gold, but then still build an economy around it, something with a high throughput transactions. And have we ever built a successful banking credit system off of cold?

[01:38:22] Never. It never works because there's too much volatility in the underlying asset. Would you take a gold denominated loan for something? And so he says, all right, I'll give you five bars of gold to go buy this car and pay me back a five and a half bars of gold. Nobody would know in five years where they come out in that kind of arrangement.

[01:38:38] The idea is that the gold is used for the settlement of transactions. And then you're operating. The actual economy is operating outside of gold. And then you kind of connect back to gold. So go back to the gold reserve. And we tried that for a long time. It didn't really work in a modern global product.

[01:38:53] We had the Bretton woods agreement and all these other things. And as I understand what you're saying, and you maybe, maybe there's some merit to that, but if that was really an earnest where they want to go, then the conversation should be about, well, how do we make it easy for layer two protocols to interact with.

[01:39:08] So why is simplicity not built into it? Why is it taking so long to do snore SIGs? Why is it taking so long to do all of these obvious upgrades, which are cryptographically low danger, also NEPA pals, non-interactive proofs a proof of work. There's no cost to doing that. It's just a property of proof of work where certain puzzles are more special than other puzzles.

[01:39:26] And by noticing that you can create these beautiful proofs that allow you to have side chains and light clients. It's not compromising security. The system is just something you get for free with proof of work. Those came out in 2016, there's derivative work, fly client floating around where the hell is it?

[01:39:41] Yeah, this is the frustration that I have is like, if you really are serious about this whole lightening and gold economy thing, I love choice. I'm a libertarian by nature. I love competition. And you know, I read all those books. I read Louis work and Marie Roth bars work. I love what Hyack had to say about private currencies.

[01:39:58] Let's go try it. That's great. But then you have to have some focus and commitment as an ecosystem and the excuse they use is, well, no, we don't because we're decentralized. And then, because we're decentralized, we don't need that as if there's some sort of guiding swarm intelligence that will naturally push the system in that particular interaction, but then you ask, well, how do people measure the success of Bitcoin?

[01:40:21] Is it the fact that they've actually achieved lots of transactions and lots of actual economic activity and lots of businesses accepting it's the price. That's what they do that. And that's the only thing they pay attention. That's why this is the most attended Bitcoin conference in history. Not because somehow Bitcoin got so much more adoption and it's because this is the highest price point Bitcoin has ever been this year, you know, over 30,000.

[01:40:46] So first of all, let me state that Charles, for the most part is purely objective. The, uh, the bias that comes in for the record. I want to say that I have heard, cause you mentioned the mafia that you prefer Goodfellows over the godfather. So a man who prefers Goodfellows over godfather, you take it for, um, that opinion for what it is.

[01:41:08] Uh, actually I have to think about that one for quite a bit. I think come on, Joe Peshy was so good at that. He's incredible. I also love casino in those big glasses on the Danielle. I love it was Sharon Stone, but we could talk about that for hours, but let me ask you about the Bitcoin conference. Cause it is.

[01:41:25] Kind of a, I would say an important moment in human history. It was quite exciting in terms of size and, and, uh, kind of, uh, turmoil and all those kinds of things. And you were there and, uh, what is it hot and humid, Miami, I believe is the way you introduced it. Uh, so what do you make of the community of Bitcoin, uh, the, or that particular event in human history?

[01:41:49] Well, it makes me sad is I remember the old Bitcoin community and I've seen what it's become. And the old community was really fun. Like the San Jose conference in 2013 or, um, subsequent conferences, you know, there's just a lot, a lot of people, they had no money and they just, they just really love this idea of decentralized money.

[01:42:05] They love this idea of decentralization and in particular, and you could strike up a conversation with everyone. There's no ego at all, but what was really fun is just, you could really get intimate friendships and relationship, great conversations with people. Uh, there, it's kind of like the early days of AI, you know, they all met at Dartmouth and all these other places.

[01:42:25] It's very intimate. There was no egos. Everybody was just trying to do some really cool stuff. Now, just like those early days, there was an over estimate of how robust the solutions would be. So we believed, oh yeah, 10 years. We're in a rural the whole world. Right. Didn't exactly happen. On the other hand, Bitcoin grew from nothing in just 11 years to I'm in Mongolia, riding camels and the camel herder has Bitcoin and there'll be desert.

[01:42:50] So that's telling you, that's a pretty pervasive technology. If you have that level of adoption that quickly, when I went to Miami, it was unrecognizable. You know, everything was so commercial. Half of the vendors at the, at the conference were like watches with that costs half a million dollars and they're recovering diamonds.

[01:43:07] So when you see that kind of materialism leak, its way in it is first is repulsive. The other thing was, there was no, like I remember one of the first conferences I mow Eleven's conference in January of 2014, the north American Bitcoin conference, ironically in Miami, there was a Bitcoin help center at booth DEMA, ran it.

[01:43:25] And a few of the other Bitcoin, jeez, ran it. The core developers actually came over like Jeff and others who were there and sat at the booth and anybody come up, ask a question, anything you want to ask about Bitcoin? And it's like, that was the culture. Just help people welcoming. There was no help booth.

[01:43:39] There, there was no notion of that. There were six hour lines and superstars and things like that. And again, again, it was always the same thing. Look how much money all these people have made. And the whole point of Bitcoin was the redefine, the notion of money redefined the notion of value, you know, these types of things.

[01:43:57] So it just, the, I I'm no longer part of that. And it made me sad because I really enjoyed being part of the, how I got started with the Bitcoin education project. I did a class on you to me. I gave it away for free. I had 80,000 students and they would email me. I got a 5,000 emails before I stopped answering them.

[01:44:12] And everyone come in and ask me some question about something. Sometimes arcane, sometimes trivial. And I take the time to sit down and answer the question or for the email to somebody I knew who could answer that particular type of question. And there were some amazing people in the early days, like my Kern and Gavin and others, and they were just super committed.

[01:44:31] And the Mike's Casey knew Satoshi. He actually emailed him back and forth because he was around 2009, 2010. He did the Bitcoin Java client. It's still, she was all excited. He said, oh wow. Bitcoin can come to a cell phone. This is really cool and exciting. And then what happened? Mike Lee left Bitcoin in 2013, over the whole big block debate that, uh, that happened.

[01:44:51] They just treated him like dirt. Like it was so human or something. So I don't know. The culture has changed a lot. And it's, if they like it, it's good for them. They can enjoy their religion. Uh, but it's, it's not for me. And where I like being, as I, like, I had a guy who used to work for me, Alex terpenoid, uh, and he created this beautiful project called ergo.

[01:45:10] To me, that is the spiritual successor to Bitcoin. Ergo is really special because it has the same culture. It has the same mentality. And the technology is kind of like a natural evolution of what you would do if you knew about Bitcoin and you wanted to build the next big thing. So it's still a proof of work system.

[01:45:26] It's still UT exosystem, but he added UTX out with some smart contracts. It's this Sigma protocol idea on the proof of work side, see Satoshi had this one CPU, one vote idea. So Alex tried to create non outsourceable puzzles to make it impossible, to have mining pools. And there's all these other beautiful little things.

[01:45:42] And he's this, he's this brilliant Russian programmer. And he's surrounded himself with all these other brilliant people. He has zero ego. It's like his negative ego. When you put it with a person with eco, your ego goes down, right. And everything about Alex is always like, how do I solve this? How do I do that?

[01:45:57] And he gets legitimately excited when he meets somebody that he can collaborate with or learn from that's where Bitcoin was in the beginning, everybody set their egos aside, whether it was how funny or whatever. And they would just say, how can I help? What can I do? And it was all about coming up with some cool new thing or solving some cool new problem.

[01:46:17] I don't see any of that in Bitcoin today. So quite a few people are excited about Argo and excited about the fact that you kind of appreciate Alex and Eric . Do you see Cardona potentially utilizing the proof of work mechanism from Argo as part of the, uh, the pool for the consensus. I mean anything's possible in, you know, there's a lot of evolution ergo has to go through.

[01:46:39] Um, and Erica was, it was kind of like, uh, when the Xbox three 61st came out while they were prototyping it, Microsoft needed a development environment and they ironically purchased a lot of apple computers to do that because apple is moving away from the power PC to Intel and Microsoft was moving towards a power PC.

[01:46:54] It's just this weird intersection of history. So at that time, the largest order of Mac computers made was done by Microsoft and they were using it for X-Box stuff. So ergo, we viewed the same way. So we said, well, we have this extended UTEC. So model the only thing that says it's sufficiently close to it, where we can beta test contracts is actually with ergo.

[01:47:12] And Alex just was a little faster in getting certain things out. Cause we, we were doing things in a slightly more rigorous way and slightly more expressive way. So we actually tested a stable coin in Oracle and other things on ergo. And it has just incredible community when we said, Hey, we're coming here to work and build all.

[01:47:29] Yeah, we love work with you guys. This is so cool. Uh, the other thing is Alex used to work for us and he had this lovely project called score X and it was all about like a pedagogical framework for building blockchains. And if you want to do prototyping or academic research, it was great. It was super modular and it's separated the consensus network and transaction layer from each other and just the right way so that you can make it modular and mix them X things.

[01:47:52] So you can put secure code Emiliana or maybe a different network layer and a different PR a consensus protocol at proof of work to another proof of work and so forth. So we loved having that kind of IP sitting around because it gave us the ability to kind of play around with ideas in a matter of weeks instead of months or years.

[01:48:07] And then he just took that concept and he gave it away. The wave protocol was built on it. Uh, that was, uh, Sasha, Ivan. Uh, he did that and I think there's two or three other cryptocurrencies that were launched from square X. And then Alex took that and built ergo from it. So there was a nice intersection where there was overlapping technology with ergo with our technology.

[01:48:27] And the other thing was that the community was so open and friendly. It was just a no brainer. Just go in and start building some things there. Now in terms of evolving ideas, the whole Sigma protocol idea is very different and it's very interesting. And there's a guy at a Boston university. His name will come to me in a segment who, uh, who came up with this stuff.

[01:48:46] And I think there's some merit there, especially as we start moving closer to this idea of blockchain is being used to validate proofs instead of running computations, Sigma protocol weather. So it's just a way of expressing, um, scripts. And, uh, basically you get these concise representations of proofs and then you can say, okay, the script is correct.

[01:49:06] You don't have to run the whole program. So there's, there's a lot, I'm not doing the topic justice. There's a lot more to it, but that's the basic concept. And in a Redeemer validator model, you need stuff like that. Because as, as your, your model gets more complex and a lot more things happen, it's you don't want to have a situation where I have to run, replay a huge amount of the UTX old graph, to be able to get to a point where I have the state of the system.

[01:49:30] You need some mathematical artifact that gives you the state of the system quickly. And then you're saying, okay, I now know how to, what, what computation thread I need to run to be able to get enough, to be able to redeem this transaction. So he just found a more compressed representation of it. And, you know, the math doesn't matter.

[01:49:45] What matters is there's a whole beautiful field that thinks about this type of stuff. And it was never once linked before and to our industry, the brilliance of Alex was to actually realize you could do that and pull those things together. And it may actually have some merit, but by no means is the only guy that does this stuff.

[01:50:03] There's actually a other approaches and verify computing, uh, that have explored that. Like my favorite came out of Microsoft research is a project called Pinocchio and there was a followup culture pedo. And the basic idea was that, uh, it's fortuitous that, you know, you have these computer science problems, like, um, hashing where you can, you can do all this computation and once you've done all of it, and you found this magic number that you can verify that the computation was done correctly.

[01:50:31] So it proof of work works this way. Hard to do the proof of work, easy to check the proof of work. Uh, cryptography also works this way. You have some trap door where it can verify something's correct, but to get that thing done, you know, if you're doing it brute force, it takes an enormous amount of computation.

[01:50:46] Well, not all problems are like this, like protein folding to verify the protein is folded correctly. You have to pull the protein, you have to redo the work. But what if for arbitrary computation, you could take a problem and then you could generate a proof that you've done that computation correctly in the proof validates and log.

[01:51:04] Or constant time. Wow, that's incredible. Right. Well, Microsoft actually wrote a paper on how to do that. It's called Pinocchio. So that's another example of these types of things, these roll-ups of things where instead of doing the computation on chain or trying to create some sort of replicated machine that does all this stuff, uh, you instead just say, okay, only thing I'm going to use the blockchain for is to check your proof, but I'm going to turn it into a distributed computing problem.

[01:51:26] Any person in the world can do this. On any server untrusted server, even because you, you don't have to trust the output you trust the proof and the proof is deterministic. It tells you these things. So whether you're using zero-knowledge your Sigma protocols, or, you know, some other mechanism, it's moving you in that particular direction to turn it from a replicated to a distributed problem and go from I'm doing the work to I'm checking that the work was done.

[01:51:50] That's fascinating. And all of a sudden we're back to the P equals NP a thing where the, for many very interesting problems, the checking is efficient, uh, as much more efficient than the solving. Right. And also, do you want complete determinism or is it probabilistic? Cause if you relax that requirement a little bit, then suddenly actually you have a broader class of things you can construct this stuff for.

[01:52:12] You mentioned UTEC so there's a paper title, the extended UTEC. So model it writes in the introduction Bitcoin and Ethereum hosting the two currently most valuable and popular cryptocurrencies use two, rather different ledger models known as the UTEC. So model and the account model respectively. At the same time, these two public blockchains differ strongly in the expressiveness of the smart contracts that they support.

[01:52:41] This is no coincidence. Ethereum chose the account model explicitly to facilitate more expressive, smart contracts on the other hand, Bitcoin chose UTEC. So also for good reasons, including that its semantic model stays simple in a complex concurrent and distributed computing environment. This raises the question of whether it is possible to have expressed the smart contracts while keeping the semantic simplicity of the UTEC sole model.

[01:53:06] Okay. So what's the fuck. That means exactly what is UTEC. So what is the account model and what is the idea of the extended UTX? All. So, I guess the easiest way of visualizing it as a UT XL is kind of like cash register accounting. So, you know, let's assume you don't have credit cards, you just have cash.

[01:53:25] And so when you go and buy some milk and potatoes or whatever, you go to the cashier, you pull out your $20 bill, you give it to them unless it comes up to 1750, they have to make change. So you don't tear your $20 bill, cut a piece of it off and say, here's part of my 20. You give them the entire $20 bill, and then they give you something back.

[01:53:46] And the things that they give you back are also atomic units. They don't cut those things up. So that's kind of what UT Excel is all about in a nutshell is that there's inputs and outputs your inputs to that 20. And your outputs will be the 1750 that goes to them. And then the remaining change that goes back to you.

[01:54:02] Okay. The problem with this particular model is that the way it was implemented with Bitcoin, there was no notion of, of how do we run complex predicates, complex contracts on this thing where instead of just saying, okay, I'm just going to push value to you. I want to put lots of terms and conditions into the movement of that value.

[01:54:22] Like you only get this. If I mow your lawn on Tuesday, or you only get this, if, uh, you know, some event happens like the Broncos win the super bowl or something like that. Okay. So you need some notion of programmability with it. So a lot of people are trying to figure out in the early days of Bitcoin, how could we improve the expressiveness of the system?

[01:54:41] And one of ways of doing it is you can go to a different accounting model, bank style, accounting. So in a bank ledger, uh, you know, every time you do it, withdrawal deposit, you know, it's an immutable system, you know, with the cash register, accounting, you don't tear up the bills, but the bank you can deduct or add leisure all the time.

[01:55:00] So Ethereum kind of works in that bank accounting system where you just, you send messages, you send transactions and you're going up or down. And so you can trigger programs the same way. So, what we did is we said, okay, if you take the UTX cell model and you have some data to it, and instead of saying, it's just a digital signature, but it's an, a script you're, you can basically create something that's still the same as cash register, but now you have programmability and the big difference is local versus.

[01:55:28] So in the case of UTX, XO, your scripts are your concerns. So whatever's going on in that cash register has no bearing or impact on the other cash registers. But when you look at bank accounting, you have to know the state of the entire banking world to be able to make that work. Why? Because if that transaction is inbound, that wire transfers in, you have to know those funds are actually there.

[01:55:48] That thing is actually happening. So when you have a global state for a program, it's like, you could do a lot more with it, but it's a lot more dangerous. And so you have to build all these mechanisms to try to protect yourself from it. So what we did is we said, okay, add data at a programmability. And you're kind of in this nice Goldilocks zone between what Ethereum did with an account style model and a global state system.

[01:56:08] And you're not as restrictive as Bitcoin, but you're still at an attorney complete world. You can still run all kinds of things. And then any standard mathematician they'll say, okay, well, is it isomorphic? You know, is there a mapping between this? What type of function can, could I actually take something expressed in one structure and transmit it to the other structure and properties are preserved.

[01:56:28] So we wrote a paper as called Comeric ledgers, where we actually showed that UT XO extending you to Excel and accounts are, are somewhat similar and that you can map things that happen in one system to the other system, the properties are preserved between the two. So in practice, what's nice about extended you take.

[01:56:45] So is that you can put infrastructure on top of it to make the development experience relatively similar to the development experience of what you would do with Ethereum, but you don't have to worry about this global state. So when you talk about sharding, it's a lot easier to do that. It's a lot more conceivable to that.

[01:57:02] And also you get determinism in the system. So when I have a Pluto smart contract, whatever I run locally is exactly what I expect to run in the system. When you have a concept of this mutable global state in the system, whatever you run locally, it's not necessarily what you're going to get when you actually push it into the system.

[01:57:18] So you may misprice things and the contract will fail. It doesn't ever happen in the Plutus world. So you got a lot of advantages with this particular model. The downside is that it's a little bit less expressive on the boundaries and a little bit harder to write certain types of software with it. But again, how you resolve that as you kind of build higher level languages and other, such things that compensate for these types of things and design patterns that compensate for these types of things.

[01:57:45] The other advantage that we have, that's really fun and exciting is that Bitcoin lives in this model. There are other utensil based systems. And so they're all talking about smart contracts as well. And they would like to continue working in the UTX zone model. So if you're a Bitcoin contract developer or other things, there's actually already a group of people that understand this very well.

[01:58:04] And that's still a, a fairly large part of the mind share of the entire space. So there are no silver bullets, and anytime you pick a particular model, there's an upside and downside. And there's different ways of doing things from cash register, accounting or bank accounting can even do different accounting models, but we felt this was kind of the best first step to go into because we started with something very familiar that had a long history behind it.

[01:58:27] And it maps very beautifully to functional programming principles, this concept of immutability and these things, and you know, much more strict management of state and, uh, no notion of having this global concept that you have to kind of manage as you break up the system. Um, now in practice, what does this mean to the developer?

[01:58:46] And when they actually start real writing an application, uh, not too much, you know, there's going to be a little bit of retooling and some new patterns you have to learn, but in practice you can still do the same things. You can implement a unit, swap tile, a style thing. In fact, we even wrote that code with the Plutus pioneers program.

[01:59:01] So you can go to YouTube and watch a lecture and see how that's done. You can do a stable coin, you can do an Oracle, you can do interactive contracts. It's just, it has to be done a little differently than the way that you would do it in an account style model. Just like you could run an application Java, you can write an application and Haskell, they both can do the same thing, but the code is going to look different and they got kind of the con the canonical way of looking at things is different.

[01:59:25] So in terms of Oracle, Oracle networks, what are your thoughts about channeling can external off-chain data sources. And, uh, everything we've been talking about now with the external, with the extended UTX whole model. Yeah. I mean, uh, trying to do smart contracts without Oracles, like trying to have sex with your pants on.

[01:59:43] I mean, it's not really fun. It's not, uh, not exactly the best of things the way I've been doing it all these years. I didn't know for any other person, Lex, I wouldn't believe you, but for you, um, that's why I'm single. This makes so much sense though. Okay. So anyway, uh, you need the outside world to be ejected it to your system, right?

[02:00:04] Try to keep a straight face. It's great. You need the outside world to make your system useful. It's like all the kinds of things that you care to do with a smart contract, usually involve human beings and information streams aggregating and doing something. So, so the Oracle is a super important component in practice for any smart contract involving any notion of value.

[02:00:24] You need to know when things have happened, how they happened, who won, who lost, et cetera, et cetera. So first, where do you get the data from? So what's the aggregator. You know, this is why we love our relationship with Wolfram. Because if you know, one of the things you'll know about Wolfram is you get to know the guy is he's a data pack, rat, every email, every communication, every interaction he's archive somewhere.

[02:00:43] Like last time I talked to him, oh yeah, I have emails from you from 2012. It's like, you still have those. Yeah. Every keystroke is written down, it's stored somewhere. So if you use Wolfram alpha, it's a similar acronym of the way his mind thinks. And so you can query the system and be like, oh, how many shipwrecks have happened in Florida between 1950 and 2000 that have resulted in more than a billion dollars of cargo loss and uh, at least one fatality.

[02:01:06] And it will return an answer. Yeah. I mean, he has this, it's an incredible source of data. That's computable, but people don't know well from alpha is more than just the thing that assists you with your math homework in high school. It's actually this giant network of data of like weather, data of location, data, just statistics, all kinds of is doing the aggregation in a way that you can query across datasets.

[02:01:30] And it's exactly this kind of idea. Th it basically represents the very kind of thing. You would hope to be able to query off chain as part of the smart contracts. Right. But the only downside is it's centralized, you know, and that's, that's always the Achilles heel of will for him is that he tends to like proprietary things and he tends to like centralizing things and mostly cause he likes running the things and, and then, you know, everybody could have an opinion on that.

[02:01:55] Um, the thing though is that after you've done aggregation, there's a question of injection. How do you get that data into the system? And you can do that in a very naive way where you can say, oh, I'm just going to attach a public key to it and it'll sign for that data, feed that injection. And then somehow, uh, I'll just trust it as it is.

[02:02:13] Or you could try to make it more complicated. You could wait data feeds from different sources and have some notion of truthiness or over your acidy metric or something like that. So it chain link is just one of many different philosophies that was born out of the academy. I believe our Juul was connected to it.

[02:02:30] Then there's some good people on that side. And it has a philosophy about how do you aggregate a philosophy about how do you ensure. And how do you create incentives? So that, that process over time gets more federated or, or more decentralized instead of centralizing around one particular setup. Now closely related corollary to this is computation off chain.

[02:02:52] So as I mentioned, smart contracts are intimately connected to our Oracle. The question is how much pre-processing and state management are you going to do outside of the system versus what do you do inside of the system? So it's a very, it's a very interesting balance between these two. And they were thinking about this stuff for a long time.

[02:03:09] There's a great paper called town crier came out way back in the day at Cornell. And that was all about using like SGX to scrape a things. And, you know, and, and you can rely on trusted hardware to give you good data. And, but you could also use those SGX cores to do contract processing, because if it runs in trusted hardware, then it's very unlikely to be tampered with or manipulated.

[02:03:28] And because of that, you can don't have to federate it or decentralize it. You can run it on a single device as if it was running on a cryptocurrency. So there seems to be a desire in that community to capture more and more of the smart contract stack and pull more and more of that stack into that layer.

[02:03:44] Two infrastructure from running on layer. One, why, because you have cost reduction and potentially because your trust model collapses to whatever chain-link is offering. You're not gaining anything by doing the computation on Ethereum, uh, or, or another platform because it's you ever watched the Simpsons.

[02:04:02] There was this beautiful episode where Mr. Burns wants to turn the power off in Springfield. That is the perfect analogy for information security. So he and Smithers, they go through this elaborate series of doors and secret passages and guard dogs and robots and shit to get to the center of the power plant to turn off the power.

[02:04:20] And when they arrive at the center of the plant, there's like this straight dog that's inside the room and there's this Wicker door that Lee and a screen door that leaves the outside. And you're like, well, why the hell did you go through this elaborate series of doors and things, if there's like a backdoor into your system?

[02:04:34] Well, that's basically a real life analogy of, of, you know, the relationship between the Oracle and the smart contract. You're only as good and your InfoSec model as your weakest link. And it doesn't matter if all of your computation is decentralized, if you're at the mercy of your data feed. Cause I can just manipulate that and break the entire security model.

[02:04:52] Yeah. Okay. You'll perfectly execute the wrong answer. So they say, well, if you're trusting us anyway, why don't you pull more of what we're you're doing on chain into our stack, which creates more transaction fees for them and more value for them. But there are many different ways you can, you can do Oracles.

[02:05:06] And when I, you know, earlier I was talking about the biology of these things, uh, cell differentiation, the minute that you admit heterogeneity in your system, and you start having cells like steak pools or things that are on and, uh, 24 7, then you can start asking the what if question, why don't you guys also provide data feeds?

[02:05:26] Why don't you guys also provide state channels or payment channels or generate random numbers for me or whatever. And you're now a service provider you're making the blockchain full-time, but part-time, you're doing this. You know, if you're making bagels, you could probably make donuts that type of a concept.

[02:05:38] So I think that type of competition is going to be very difficult for a lot of these, a layer, two protocols that aren't tightly coupled with the protocol, because the ones that are tightly coupled with a protocol, they have a built in trust advantage. They've already built a commercial reputation.

[02:05:56] There's already an increasingly more decentralized set. The other thing is you don't need a token. You can just use ADA, you know, you can, you don't need an Oracle coin for these types of things to work. And by the way, that's just for the injection component and the veracity at testation. So is it true or not?

[02:06:12] That's not about the aggregation. That's still a tremendously time intensive, expensive proposition. There's only a few people in the world that have what Steve has with Wolfram. Uh, and those guys by just cutting off those supply to replicate what they have is something that would cause hundreds of millions or billions of dollars.

[02:06:29] And so it's an interesting question of how do you incentivize decentralized aggregation of information and that's kind of what town crier and other protocols we're trying to achieve. So maybe you can say how town cryo works, because it's like, how do you, what's your vision? You're not partnering was Wolf from Wolf, from alpha in sort of exploring this partnership of, uh, data and, uh, the blockchain.

[02:06:51] What's your vision for possible distributed version of Wolfram alpha. Well, you know, the first step is just say, can we use this as a feed? And they can be what Bloomberg is to the financial markets. You know, so you have a terminal and you have something and there's always a value of at least offering choice.

[02:07:06] And so we're, it's not like we're anti chain link or we're picking winners and losers. It's an open protocol, it's an open system. So if we're successful chain link will migrate or it will at least support us because they like money. You know, they like users like liquidity. It's a disservice to their community, not to support a potential customer set, but you know, you're going to have a spectrum from the desire to do a completely decentralized aggregation, curation, injection, and veracity attestation, to a completely centralized vertically integrated set.

[02:07:36] You need to be able to have that whole spectrum and offer that to the smart contract developer to decide, you know, what is, what makes sense by the way, a lot of cases they're going to be their own Oracle. So for example, the world of Warcraft example that I gave, you know, it's a completely centralized thing.

[02:07:51] It's a video game run by a single company. Uh, there's no sense that saying that we're somehow going to decentralize that what they're just trying to do is extend their currency or NFTs or whatever into new marketplaces. So the minting of that is controlled by a single entity and the world's state of that.

[02:08:08] You just have to trust blizzard to inject that into the system. You could try to imagine some sort of like, you know, Sentinel group of people within the game who keep blizzard honest, but it's completely unnecessary because they can change the rules of the system arbitrarily. So in that case, you're optimizing around efficiency and cost reduction.

[02:08:27] So you'd want a single feed that gets injected into the system from that. If you look at a stable coin, that's algorithmic and it's basing its value on the aggregation of many different exchanges, that's the polar opposite example because there you're saying, okay, what's the price of my asset relative to some basket, but what, how do I know that the price feeds that I'm looking at are accurate?

[02:08:49] You'd have to look at Binance and Bittrex and all these other things, or maybe there's conventional Forex exchanges or something like that. Okay. Well, how do you weight that and how do you clip outliers? And you know, these types of things, that's a completely different conversation and there's a lot more mechanics you have to put in for that bundling and attestation of the veracity of the data feed.

[02:09:08] And what happens if you get it wrong, your stable coin gets mispriced and everything goes to hell. And you know, the markets will eventually correct it for arbitrage seeking behavior, but anything that was built on that will fail in the, in the short term. So Oracle's really just a game. You know, you have to build a standardized interfaces and make it as easy as possible for people to do that.

[02:09:27] And then let people choose how they want to inject data. And what level of assurance do they need behind that? And the question is how much do you leave to the user versus how much does the protocol take care of for you? And it's a difficult design question for our part. You know, w we love working with Steve and Wolfram and they're, they're a great company and they really have some bright people there.

[02:09:47] And we know on the data set that they're second to none because not only they have it, it's computable, you can do all kinds of things and manipulate with a very rich query language. So that's a great thing. And we want to make sure that that's accessible to developers and Cardinal, but remember they're like Bloomberg, it's a centralized feed in that respect.

[02:10:04] So if you want to build a chain, chain-link S competitor, you know, there's other protocols you could do for that. Now you asked about town crier. And that was, that was an attempt to kind of, uh, you know, like sweep the oceans with the net, you know, get some, uh, get the data through a decentralized way. I, and that was just saying, Hey, let's use trusted hardware to go read law, all kinds of websites, other things.

[02:10:24] And because it's trusted hardware, the scraping is non-biased, you know, if you find something inconvenient to whatever the person who's scraping, is it trusted hardware will still do it. And it can't be changed. You'd have to manipulate SGX to do that. Uh, so that's great, but you still run to the problem of how do you wire that together, the underlying websites still don't have any notion of veracity or reputation behind them.

[02:10:47] And then you also have the issue of storage where the hell do you put all of it? Yeah. If you have exabytes of data, what's the incentive for that? That's the dream of the semantic web. I still think is a fascinating idea. I have to basically convert the internet into, um, a court, like, um, a knowledge base that you can, you can query, you can integrate in the same way you did with Wolfram from alpha, but much bigger.

[02:11:10] Right? But that, that means basically revolutionizing the way we put the internet together, which I think these ideas of off-chain data will, um, will motivate people because there's a lot of money to be made in creating finally there's money to be made with a semantic web. So that that'd be an interesting kind of feature.

[02:11:32] I do want to ask you about video games really quick. Cause a small tangent, cause you said this really interesting idea of blizzard being centralized control. Is it possible to have items in the game. That are not controlled by blizzard sure. Being controlled in a decentralized fashion that you can be like, what is it?

[02:11:53] The grandfather sword in Diablo? Hmm. What was it really? Somebody was criticizing me. I said, I was saying all these kinds of nice things about Diablo three. And they said, Diablo two, resurrected is coming out. They need to check it out. There's a lot of, there's a lot of camps, Diablo two as far better.

[02:12:10] That's what they're saying. This is the war that they're having. Okay. So we'll play, it's coming out soon. I'll play it fine. But nevertheless, those items are owned by blizzard. Is there, is it possible to create video games where items are owned by the people like outside of blizzard? And, uh, do you think in like a half century from now, we will all live in those games and we'll forget the physical space even.

[02:12:36] Yeah. That's definitely possible. I look at crypto kitties. That's a great example of that. Can you explain what CryptoKitties is? It's basically just a video game that kind of lives on a blockchain and the creatures within the game can breed with each other and create new crypto kitties and you can own them.

[02:12:50] So it's like, like, like some sort of dystopian Tamagotchi with lots of money behind. But anyway, you know, the thing is those assets actually have a blockchain based representation. And so whether the, the infrastructure that hoists up that game off chain goes on or off, because that ledger exists outside of the game, any person can come in and replicate it, restore it and, you know, turn it back on, uh, sands intellectual property.

[02:13:16] So, yeah, it's completely possible to, to break your architecture up where you have a notion of the player part, and then you have a notion of the experience part and you can interchange experiences almost like you do cascading style sheets or something for you to have different presentations and the ownership of the underlying layers, the players.

[02:13:36] So, yeah, that, that's definitely doable. And frankly, that's, what's going to happen in the gaming world because there's so much value in that. I mean, everybody wants play and you know, right now the model is you make a game, you sell license. And you, you have a huge surge of people at the beginning of the game, buying the video game, and then you have this long tail, but you've gotten almost 95% of your value.

[02:13:56] In the first six months, you have a huge churn rate. The odds are the vast majority of people won't be playing the game within 12 months. But if you can create an interactive game where there's an actual Connie inside the game, then you have Eve online or second life, or any of these things where you have people playing for 10 years and there's like people buying virtual real estate and all these other things, you as the game developer actually don't have to create a lot of content.

[02:14:17] So your long tail gets lot fatter and it generates a lot more revenue and your cost of operating system is fairly fixed or diminishing. So the economics align for doing exactly what you're, uh, what you're talking about. I think it will get done. I just saw recently sort of this calculation that people played a while and fortnight for 140 billion hours.

[02:14:41] So, and that's without the economic incentives there. So do you think it's possible that like most of our economy in the future, we play of people playing video games, essentially like, okay, so one, one vision of the future, especially with AI and automation that people like, um, that would get wealthier and wealthier, there's this kind of rising GDP for the entire world.

[02:15:04] And then people are losing their jobs, but they're still a, well-off enough to be able to have a high quality of life. So we're all looking for meaning and meaning, we'll find this boy playing video games, and now there's this extra low levels. Like you can be a bill gates within a video game world in the digital world as the physical world, uh, is that you think that's the future.

[02:15:24] You just want to have the Westworld, if you can't tell the difference, does it matter outer to. Uh, did you ever interview, you have all Harari? Was he eventually? Well, yeah, but you know, I guess, you know, homogeneous, that's kind of like the roadmap there, right? This headedness stick dystopia where everybody just lives wired into some simulation.

[02:15:44] And I there's some movies about that ready player one. And, um, the other one was surrogate as a fourth. So yeah, it was how Hollywood is certainly visualize what this could be, but, you know, I, I'm not so pessimistic in that respect. Um, I do believe that the video game world is evolving at an amazing pace.

[02:16:01] If you look at where unreal is, that is just incredible, the latest unreal engine and within one or two more ticks of that clock, the iteration. So five to 10 years, the photo realism will be so good that it will be hard to distinguish between real life and, uh, in video games and, you know, the hardware isn't was there.

[02:16:20] So the question is then when you have photo realistic experiences where you've, you've successfully traverse the on candy valley to a point where it's good enough, then, uh, will virtual reality be more desirable than actual reality. And for the vast majority of people, the answer is probably yes, because actual reality is tough.

[02:16:40] It's hard, you know, but then your knowledge of that you live in a virtual world actually becomes a problem for you. So there's going to be this kind of sad dark industry where people try to create amnesia where they're not aware that they're inside the virtual world. And so that's that's why is it sad?

[02:16:58] I mean, it's almost like, uh, because you know, it's, it's not real, but if, if you could forget that it's not real, then you believe what you're experiencing is real. Yeah. But yeah. So what you forget, like you forget all the ugly parts of life, which is the physical, the meat space, and then usually get to enjoy video again.

[02:17:16] But it's always lurking in the back of your mind that you're in the matrix. I have to not be in the major. So it's just why the ball dude in the matrix was like, I want to be rich and have a beautiful wife and eat a steak every day. You know, he didn't want to know he was in the matrix. So you would take the red pill, not the blue pill.

[02:17:31] Well, no, hang on. Is it depends on how good the virtual world is. Well, that's what I'm trying to tell you is, I mean, isn't that what most of the beautiful experiences about a human life are, is forgetting for a moment for time, like the mess of it. Yeah. I mean, that's what love is, is you forget, like all of a sudden everything is beautiful.

[02:17:53] But like the reality is you're going to lose that person, most likely level fade. And no matter what, even if it doesn't, you're both going to be dead soon. Right. So I'm taking the blue call on that one went full Ernest Becker on me, man.

[02:18:10] Oh, right. You know, I get what you're saying though. And it actually, and, but, but then they, it begs the question, how do we, and it goes back to the very first question you asked in this interview, which is like, how do we know we're not in a simulation or, you know, is this this Bostrom concepts or these ideas like real well, it's entirely possible that we are.

[02:18:26] And that we, we desire to be because the real world is horrible, horrifically, dystopian or bad, or maybe we're actually don't exist. We're completely virtual. And does it matter? And I'd argue that it probably doesn't at, um, you know, at some certain point, if you're at the end of your life and your nineties dying of cancer, you know, the fact that you can live out being young, healthy, and 25 is probably a desirable thing.

[02:18:48] And no one would ever complain about that, where it becomes problematic is if the vast majority of society enters this virtual simulacra of reality. And as a consequence, nothing works because there's no one to do anything. Society falls apart in that respect, you know, there's no desire to do anything in the real world.

[02:19:05] Innovation stops the desire to actually do real work stops because you're always inside this virtual economy. Uh, so I don't know, it's, it's, it's an interesting question, but, you know, drawing it back more to where we're at today, um, the evolution factors are there, you know, VR is evolving at a very rapid rate.

[02:19:22] Uh, the game engines are just incredible to today and they're really doing amazing things. And there seems to be an overwhelming desire for people to escape the harshness of where they live just by evidence, by how many billions of hours have been spent playing video games. People still play Skyrim.

[02:19:39] Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's probably my favorite game of the whole eldest girl series. But you know, it's fascinating because smart contracts is actually the mechanism by which we take a lot of the meets based stuff and move it to the digital world so that this is the, all the stuff we've been talking about is really probably the mechanisms which take us there, which, uh, I find that world not dystopian.

[02:20:03] I find them well quite utopian, cause there's so many opportunities to create beautiful experiences. Uh, but since we're talking about the future, let me ask you a timeline question. Or even just like definitional, what is Alonzo. You mentioned, uh, some fun, hello, world experiments going on. Right. Uh, and how, and when we'll card down, I'll get smart contracts.

[02:20:26] Yeah. So Alonzo church is a famous, famous mathematician computer science guy, and he was a contemporary of touring. And there was like these three different views of computing, recursive functions from curdle and turning machines from touring and in church had Lambda calculus, and they're all equivalent and they all give you the ability to build a computer.

[02:20:42] So we like functional programming. So we decided that's your favorite church? So we had to name something after church and it's, it's, it's just weird that, you know, we never did. So we said, okay, Alonzo is, is a good release name. Basically it was bringing smart contracts to Cardona. It took us a long time to get here and we'll be there in the next 90 days, you know, it's, uh, we like everything we do.

[02:21:03] There's a process. And so there's all the colors of the rainbow. We start with Alonzo blue and then white and purple. Uh, and each step you do some more things. You bring more users in, and then eventually you get to a threshold where you say, okay, everything works the way intended and you push a button and we initiate, what's called a Hartford Combinator event.

[02:21:20] And boom, the system has smart contracts. You just wake up and it's there. It's like, it's in your house. This is going to be when I got my blue check mark on Twitter, I woke up and. Yeah. Just like Christine, you will never the same. You can't, you can't go back. It's a yeah, like hard fork. It's a hard fork of Charles.

[02:21:36] Yeah, exactly. Well, actually I think you can take it away, but can they take my check mark away, but that'd be like a hard fork backwards, I guess. Okay. So, uh, so great. So that's, uh, but currently there's a, so there's, um, there's a testing procedure, uh, going on to see, uh, what does that look like and what will give you confidence that things are working with?

[02:22:00] Yeah. So first you start with the Mary era, which is where we were right now. Multi-asset so you can do metadata and issue tokens on Cartano, but you'd have limited programmability on chain. Alonzo adds the programmability in, but we already have most of the foundations of the extended you take. So model and the smart contract is just those things aren't ready.

[02:22:19] So the first step is say, fork. It, so all those rules are now there. Okay. So that's what we did with lots of blue. We forked a Testnet based layer and it's successfully survived going from Mary to Alonzo, which means that you can move transactions from one side to the other, both systems work. And then the next step is say, okay, Are the state poll operators.

[02:22:39] People run the infrastructure, able to run this test net just like they run Cardinal. And that's what we're doing right now with blue. We're bringing all these SPS then, and then are we able to submit and runs smart contracts on the system? And they actually return a round trip. You send something, it gets something back.

[02:22:53] Yay. Okay. Um, so that's where we're at. And then what you do is each step. So the next is white. You go from like 50 people to several hundred and then purples an open Testnet where we want every single person, the entire ecosystem to use it. And it's also a dev net. So that means that people are writing with clues, playground, and local interpreters.

[02:23:12] Their smart contracts can actually start testing them now on the public infrastructure. So it's kind of like releasing, um, dev kits to the Xbox or something like that. You send them out to game developers before you released the X-Box, so they can test their video games in anticipation of the release of the system.

[02:23:27] So you run that for at least a month. And as long as it doesn't blow up in your face and oh God, what have we done? Hindenburg? Oh, the humanity, uh, you release it and you know, you ship it. The problem is it's no longer in our control. You know, there's over a hundred exchanges that have listed Cardona.

[02:23:42] There's lots of wallet, infrastructure there, thousands of different constituencies. So it's less of a technological problem now, and it's more of a coordination problem. So you have to evolve in a very methodical way and each step of the way you bring new actors in, they get ready for it. They upgrade their infrastructure to it.

[02:23:59] And then like shells. Eventually you get to the outer shell, which is the hard fork for the general public. And if we've done it right like that blue check mark, they wake up and it's exactly the same. Just get a little update, date, your client, uh, and they start demanding Wagyu beef. Is there stuff you're worried about in terms of like, when something's this tricky.

[02:24:21] You know, goes up several orders of magnitude in terms of scale. Are there problems that you foresee? Is there like, um, like we said, there's game theoretic aspects, all those kinds of things. Like what worries you the most? I mean, I sleep like a baby. I wake up every two hours crying,

[02:24:40] ah, damn. As a good line, full of good lines. Um, I mean there's a lot, they just made me realize that expression makes no sense. Uh, I slept like a baby, but go ahead. Exactly. Right. Messing your whole world up right now, Alexa? Um, no, I mean, there's so much that keeps me up at night. You know, it's like you're in a cold sweat every day when you have an ecosystem like this, cause you, you, you, you, the other thing is you're judged as much by the applications.

[02:25:04] People build on the platform as you are by the platform you've constructed. So, you know, one of the most unfair things that happened in our industry was blaming Fatalis for the Dow hack. He didn't write the code. He wasn't responsible for it. It's completely independent different team. And because it blew up, a lot of people just developed this idea.

[02:25:21] If Ethereum is not secure, I'm a fundamentally broken and it's true. There are some issues there, but come on that's that's like saying, oh, well, you know, Photoshop didn't work. Fuck bill gates. Yeah. You know, and that's the issue is you get, you get. As a platform developer, you know, inter coupled with the wins and losses of your application developers.

[02:25:41] So if they go do amazing things, it's like, oh yeah, windows. It is great. We love it. And if they go do terrible things, they're like, oh man, I guess he's trying to kill all of us. Um, so what, what. Kept up at night about is not just what we've constructed, but also how do we curate an ecosystem and foster development of an ecosystem where you have assurance baked into the application and that's somehow expressible to the user.

[02:26:04] So when you download your smart contract or you click your one-click install, the users, unit swab, clone, or whatever the hell it is that's deployed on Cartano you have little green check mark or something that indicates to you that somebody audited the code or it followed a specification. The lack of that is problematic because then first there's impersonations the whole, my ether wallet thing, or like your videos or my videos are the same, every comment there's a bot that says, Hey, you know, give me some money or something like that, that kind of stuff happens.

[02:26:31] But then just protocol level flaws, like what happened with the Dow hack? That's what really keeps me up at night. How do you resolve that problem? Because I don't hire these people. I don't tell them what to do. I didn't tell them how to build things on the platform. They may have tons of experience and knowledge that could be Simon Peyton Jones, or they could have absolutely no knowledge whatsoever.

[02:26:50] And they read one tutorial and they've written three lines of code in their entire life. And they've deployed something horribly broken copy paste, and suddenly it all goes to hell. I'm judged by both. That's what really keeps me up at night. And we're as a company trying to figure out. And as the ecosystem, trying to figure out standards like at university of Wyoming, we're setting up, um, the smart contract engineering Institute.

[02:27:10] We're negotiating with them right now. And the goal there is just to create some, you know, standards for how to certify smart contracts so that you can get that green check mark and know that it's, it actually has some assurance level behind it, but God, that's a huge coordination problem. And it's a huge information presentation, problem, and incentives problem and so forth.

[02:27:29] And unfortunately, people who value being first to market will kind of piss in the pool for everybody else. In terms of, uh, maybe you can cut. On the topic of decentralized exchanges, uh, what kind of decentralized exchanges Dex is? What are they first of all, and what kind would you like to see built around Cardona?

[02:27:48] Yeah, so people want to create exchanges that don't have custodial risk. The point of exchange is to build you a marketplace where bids and asks can find each other market. People can meet and trade that you can find a price, you can get liquidity. So, you know, you got gold. You want to turn your goal into dollars.

[02:28:05] Okay. Well, somebody has to create a marketplace for, so like Coinbase is an example of marketplace, but centralized, the problem is you have custodial risk. So when you put your gold and your dollars, your, or your digital representations of these things into the exchange, what if, you know, Wally, he, he was, he even broke up with him and now he's really sad and he's gone to the dark side and he's become Wally the hacker.

[02:28:27] Okay. So he can go and sneak his way in and hack into Coinbase and steal all your, your goal and your tokens. So instead of you actually being on swap these things, you've lost all your money. There's other problems too. Like, like what say, you know, uh, Daisy has now come in and become a regulator and said, oh, I don't like these exchanges anymore.

[02:28:44] I'm just going to shut them all down. Yeah. Yeah. And then you have no access to it. So you have sovereign risk, you have the risk of threat. You have regulatory risk, you have the issue of banks, maybe cutting you out. So it's been in our industry for more than 10 years. Mt. Gox was the most famous example of that.

[02:28:59] They collapsed, I believe in 2013 and hundreds of millions of dollars was. Over the course of a while. It's the point of the decks is saying, can we do what a marketplace does, but not have Coinbase, not have a central actor run this thing. And there's a lot of problems with that because exchanges are generally, uh, creatures of latency.

[02:29:21] You know, high-frequency trading, for example, they do things that nanosecond, they co-located locate their infrastructure with the exchange software, just so they can front run orders over other people. I mean, it's crazy the amount of technology that they put in. So the traditional wall street version of an exchange is very centralized, very fast, very optimized, and kind of behaves by a very close set of rules.

[02:29:44] When you look at a Dex, you have to accept that you're going to have to have slightly different rules because you're operating on a Koelbel systems latency and you're operating in a system that has different behaviors. However, that said, there's a lot of great protocols that have been built for it. You know, unit swap has kind of evolved a lot over the years, uh, and we've seen a huge competition and a lot of evolution to basically build out protocols that kind of excuse some of these security problems, enjoy high liquidity.

[02:30:10] And then also have this beautiful, uh, concept of openness. One of the gatekeepers to crypto when you're a cryptocurrency developer are the exchanges. I remember when we first created Carnados, you know, the, the, we, the Bitfinex guys reached out the Cardinal foundation. They said, oh, we'd be happy to list data as it.

[02:30:27] Okay. And they said, yeah, we want $5 million to do it. You know? So there was kind of a, some Italian for go fuck yourself in those email conversations. I think, fuck what I said. Um, but, uh, but anyway, there was that kind of back and forth happens all the time. And, and because these guys are gatekeepers, they, they have this nepotistic control information asymmetries and so forth.

[02:30:48] So having a Dex, you don't have that. You have open listing and you basically just put the asset into it and if anybody wants to trade it, they will. And if it seems like it's a good idea, natural market will form market-making will occur and you get liquidity with it. So there's no barrier to entry for that type of system.

[02:31:05] The biggest existential problem for Dexis right now is the concept of regulation. Uh, so basically right now, when you use Binance or Coinbase or these other guys, you have to go through KYC and AML, know your customer, and anti-money a lottery. So basically who are you? And you know, is your money real or not, or are you a drug dealer or something?

[02:31:24] So normally you do that by saying, okay, I'm going to give them my copy of my passport. And maybe they're going to request some tax records or whatever the best practices are for the particular jurisdiction. And then that exchange is liable if that's fucked up. So the government comes in and says, Hey guys, uh, you know, we pull your compliance records and they find discrepancies.

[02:31:44] They'll actually put the exchange out of business or find them very heavily. Uh, JP Morgan chase got $19 billion in finance, in fines over the last 20 years for various compliance issues amongst other things. Uh, so this is expensive, very difficult thing. And a Dex it's open system. You just have value coming in, not identity.

[02:32:03] And so all these things are trading amongst the anonymous accounts. And so there's no notion of compliance right now for that. So a lot of regulators are coming in and saying, oh, well this is just a cesspool for terrorism and drug dealing and bad study. And they they're word salad of, of bullshit, but you know, it is what it is.

[02:32:19] You have to deal with these guys. And so there's been a lot of discussions of, can we take Dexis and we'll keep the openness and keep the liquidity and no counterpart or custodial risk. And can we add some notion of compliance to that? And it just centralized way that doesn't require a single actor to be a gatekeeper.

[02:32:37] So I think actually by combining DIDs decentralized identifiers, that's the way to do it, but it's actually the next generation of the technology. It's the regulated decks then, you know, who regulates that? How does that work and so forth? But I think ultimately those are going to be the only marketplaces that, uh, ended up surviving in this current environment.

[02:32:54] If your desire is to exit to a dollar, if you don't really care about the Fiat side, like a traditional legacy currency, you can always do things in a shadowy unreal unregulated way, but I mean, it's a personal preference and a business preference. Can we kind of return to a. To proof of work and proof of stake.

[02:33:13] There's just so many topics I want to talk to you about. So I'll jump around a little bit, but, uh, at the Bitcoin conference, Jack Dorsey, uh, spoke, I think, I believe you said, uh, Bitcoin changes everything. I think he made a video for Jack trying to explain different ideas to him. Uh, I guess describing the difference between proof of work and proof of stake.

[02:33:33] Cause we've talked about what do you hope Jack Dorsey comes to understand about the difference between proof of work and proof of stake? Oh, I hope he understands. It's just a resource. That's the entire point of the video I was trying to make is like, dude, you're like in this cult where you think the only way to be secure is proof of worker and somehow proof of stake is less secure than proof of work.

[02:33:52] I don't even know how you, you put those inequalities there. Cause you're talking about apples and oranges. You're, you're making different trade-offs and there's different assumptions about the nature of the people involved, but the mechanics are the same. And so it's really more of a question of what type of system do you prefer?

[02:34:08] Do you want mercenaries guarding Rome or do you want Roman citizens carving Rome. Okay. And as the Romans learned, it's better to have citizens usually doing okay. And that's the only point I was trying to make to a, to Dorsey. And, you know, I don't think he watched it or particularly cared, uh, but it was more of a video for everyone.

[02:34:26] And to start that dialogue of realizing that the real game is not, is proof of stake, better than proof of work. It's how do we go from one to end and what should end be? You just mentioned that semantical, addressable web, going back to IPFS and these other concepts, well, what, how do you pay for the enormous burden of storing that much data?

[02:34:46] You can create a consensus protocol for it. There actually is one it's called PERMA coin came out in 20 14, 15 Andrew Miller wrote it. And a few other authors I think are, um, John Katz may have been an author as well, but basically it was just a, you know, a throwaway proof of work style algorithm that only works if you have large amounts of data.

[02:35:05] Okay. So it's like, uh, your minor is like a hard drive, effectively prove a storage. I think you call them this, this type of stuff. And there's been since then many iterations, evolutions of that type of protocol. Okay. So what if you throw that into your resource bag? Now you have a capacity in your system for storing huge amounts of.

[02:35:24] That's incentivized by the way the system works. And you can balance that with a proof of stake system. And you can balance that with a Missy, you have proof of useful computation. We may have a paper on that who knows coming soon. Uh, and what if you have a proof of useful computation where maybe you can do walk stat or something who knows, uh, w was something like that.

[02:35:42] Okay, well now you have three resources inside your system. And those three things keep your system secure. They keep each other balanced and they just so happened to create the world's largest, super computer that's programmable. And it just so happens to create the world's largest database. That's programmable, in addition to having a shareholder style model for ownership inside of it, to kind of balance these things out.

[02:36:02] So people care about the appreciation of value. And so the system that was my point to Jack is you're a business guy. Why are you betting all your eggs? And one crazy model. That's a called step away and realize that that does something it's a tool, but saws are the only tool in the toolbox there's hammers and screwdrivers and other things go to and resources.

[02:36:22] And let's have a real conversation about what would a world computer or a world infrastructure that's useful for your business domain in his case, Twitter require. And what type of resources would you need for the, when this case square, more importantly, currently, you feel that the square and cash app, they support a Bitcoin.

[02:36:40] You know, he is kind of all in on the proof of work idea, not all in, but currently kind of, um, that's the one supported, just a tip and proof of work. I love you so much, Charles. Thank you. Appreciate this. But, uh, I'm not going to run with that even though I'm tempted to, uh, but uh, looking forward, do you hope car Dano becomes part of cat.

[02:37:07] I mean, he's a business guy or at least I'd hope he is, and it's not about what I want or what he wants. It's about what markets want. You know, when you run a publicly traded company, you have a fiduciary obligation to your shareholders to maximize the utility, sustainability and value of your company. Uh, and so if he's running, you know, a company that makes money off of these things, it makes absolutely no sense to be a maximalist.

[02:37:30] You want transaction volume. That's how you make your damn money. It was Coinbase was the same way. They were very maximalist at the beginning very quickly. They started realizing, Hey, we're, we're losing a lot of money. If we want to IPO, we kind of need to be a bit more diverse. Eric for he's was also a maximalist way back today.

[02:37:46] Now look at Eric, he's got shapeshift and all these other pieces of infrastructure. He's, he's a lot more friendly with us Altese so, you know, Jack will make that decision. His people will make that decision. I think, based on market dynamics, transaction volume, and value to the user. And if the concern is actually legitimately security, then the only question I'd asked their team is, can you please provide me a definition of what you're doing?

[02:38:10] Pow is more secure than proof of stake has a tweet. Isn't is not really approved. Okay. You need to actually come out and sit down and say, what is your security model? What do you care about? What do you value? What's the problems you're concerned about proof of stake. Uh, and they never really get there.

[02:38:25] And that's why I call a maximum, like a religion, because it's just like saying, you know, the angels descended from the heavens and it's like, well, how do you know? Well, because the Bible said, so, or this doctrine said, so it's like, well, that's your evidence. Somebody wrote something down to, can you please give me a little bit more?

[02:38:41] They say, no, you're challenging the word of God. And this case you're challenging the word of Satoshi. And all I ask for is just, what is the burden of proof? We wrote the papers. We have security models. We went through the peer review process. God, that was not easy. We wrote formal specifications and some cases we formalize those specifications with Isabel for God's sakes, which is not easy to do.

[02:39:00] Uh, and then we implemented it and it's running in production with a million users at a $50 billion market cap. I mean it, what point does it, you do you start saying, well, maybe there's something there, you know, and they say, no, there's nothing there and it's not secure. It can't be secure. And he said, okay, then why do you believe what you believe?

[02:39:17] And they never come back to me with an answer ever. Well, I believe God, didn't go through a peer review process when you wrote the 10 commandments. So, um, sometimes it works out sometimes not. Uh, let me ask on that same thread. Tesla space X on Musk currently invested in Bitcoin, but are openly looking to explore other cryptocurrency investments.

[02:39:39] What case would you make for Cardona? Well, if they truly care about alternative energy and sustainability, you know, carbon reduction or carbon neutrality, you, you can't be in a system where there is no built-in mechanism to constrain the energy consumption. You know, with proof of stake, energy consumption is a negative it's.

[02:39:58] You want to minimize it. If you can get the same amount of stuff done on a raspberry PI, as you can, a big server, you're going to do it on the PI because ultimately that server costs and an energy cost is coming out of your budget with proof of work, any innovation you come up with to optimize power, uh, you just build more Asics because, you know, it's, oh, it's 30% more power efficient, great.

[02:40:19] By 30% more, you keep you keep, you keep, you keep adding to the works that because you want more hash power, more hash power, more share of the pie. So you have no energy savings component. And I know these people are saying, well, there's a lot of wasted energy in the grid, and this is kind of incentivizing using that wasted energy.

[02:40:37] And it's a better way of storing it than batteries. Cause you're now storing it as a Bitcoin instead of storing it as, okay. Maybe there's some truth to that. But, um, anyway, the energy is a critical point for you. Like the, yeah. And that's exactly right. The energy is a critical point for me with Tesla because they assert to be an alternative energy company.

[02:40:58] And unless they can make the case that somehow the proliferation of Bitcoin is legitimately going to proliferate batteries, solar, and wind or other things, then it's probably good for them to just focus on the most efficient energy efficient cryptocurrency possible. Otherwise you're exacerbating global warming, you're exacerbating the ecological consequences of it.

[02:41:18] The other thing is Bitcoin is the least programmable of all the cryptocurrencies that if you want to do interesting, sexy, unique things, let's say Tesla, for example, uh, they want to start doing VDI and VTV for, uh, for autonomous vehicles and have the vehicles start talking to each other and connect it to 5g.

[02:41:33] Well magic. If you want to build a telco coin or, you know, some sort of 5g coin, and you want to build an IOT layer network, there's just no real way to do that on Bitcoin with the way it's designed. So you'd need fundamentally different infrastructure to create such a token and regulate such a system and have these things autonomously, negotiate, and do business with each other.

[02:41:52] You need Dexis and stable coins and all kinds of mechanics to make something like that possible. Well, that's really beneficial the Tesla, if they could figure that out because it create like an information sharing incentive scheme, where if the cars talk to each other, including other branded cars, like GM cars and Ford, they can now actually get data from those cars through a marketplace in exchange for the benefit of autonomous driving or for the benefit of understanding road conditions or safety enhancements, so forth.

[02:42:18] So it's just depending. Are you just here to speculate? Are you here to actually use it as another medium of exchange or do you actually want to build infrastructure on this thing? The more closely you get to utility that the further down the road you get there, then the more programmability you need.

[02:42:33] And so it makes a lot more sense to be an Ethereum fan or a Cardinal fan than to be a Bitcoin fan. So to be both with a stake and have the smart contracts capabilities. Yes. And that's why we went over to Ethereum because their proof of work, you mentioned God, God spelled backwards is dog. How's that for a transition.

[02:42:55] And, uh, you know, Musk and Tesla are at least a little bit curious about a coin called doge coin, right? You made a video directed to Ilan on how to improve Dorsch coin. What are your ideas for making doge coin even better than it already is? Well, you know, don't you go and just base, it's a F it's like that nine inch nails song, a copy of a copy of a copy.

[02:43:20] Yeah. This is a copy of a copy. It's a Bitcoin gave light coin, light coin gave doge coin and it was kind of a parody cryptocurrency. And I think Jackson was trying to do it to like prove a point about all coins and then true to forms. Like nobody caught the doctrine and completely perverted the entire religion.

[02:43:35] It's almost like the emperor of man and Warhammer 40 caves like this atheist don't worship me. And now there's like this whole religion built around the emperor. So doge coin has become a thing and it's become such a large thing that it is a reasonable target for somebody to fix it up and repair it and make it an interesting cryptocurrency.

[02:43:52] The point of the video was to show what a modern third generation cryptocurrency really would. It's a major overhaul and there are already people doing this, you know, there's the Solanas and the harmony ones and the Kardos Neos and all these other guys. And they have billions of dollars and huge dev teams and all these innovative protocols.

[02:44:09] If you're really serious about this thing, sticking around, being useful in doing stuff, then the point of the video was to show the types of things you'd have to think about and the types of papers that are all open source, patent free, and don't have any notion of intellectual property behind them that his engineers could grab and go and do.

[02:44:28] And, uh, he did mention on Twitter that he was looking for feedback on how to improve doge. And so I said, all right, well, I'll just put all these things together. It was a little tongue in cheek because I figured he'd ignore it. Uh, but it was also showing how hard it is to innovate in this tire space. You know, you don't just go and say, I'm going to go build a battery power car or rocket, or enter a new industry.

[02:44:48] It's really hard to do that. You spend years and lots of effort. You have to do series of small learning steps. You have to pick up destroyed rockets on the side of the beach and things like that before you get to the rocket landing itself. Well, analogously, it's really hard to build a cryptocurrency Satoshi probably spent years thinking carefully, and that work was a derivative of 30 years of work and the digital assets based starting in 1980s working its way through.

[02:45:15] So, and then Bitcoin only did very limited things relative to what a theorem can do or Cartano can do and so forth. So the minute that you extend that complexity, you're talking about years of R and D years of engineering effort that needs to be done. So what's the point of doge? Is it just a meme? Uh, is it actually contending to be useful or is it a competing as a store value against Bitcoin?

[02:45:37] Now, if it's competing as a store value against Bitcoin, why the hell does it have the monetary policy? It does also there's predatory distribution of the underlying asset. And over 90 some percent is consolidated less than 1% of the holders for dose, for doge coin at a very, very low price point. So they can sell at almost any price point and make.

[02:45:56] So, you know, it hits 50 cents. There, there are billionaires and, and it's not like 20,000 people. It's probably less than a hundred wallets that have that distribution. So there's this existential ticking time bomb. That's in dojo that once the guys who are vested start selling, they can just keep selling.

[02:46:12] It keeps selling it right at all the way down and make windfall profits, regardless of what price they sell out. And who are they selling against the retail investors? You know, people make $500 spare money a month or something like that. And it bothers me because I see it in my community. So I live in Longmont, Colorado, and I was at a restaurant and I was talking to the waitress and she asked me what business it.

[02:46:34] And I said, I'm in the cryptocurrency space. And she's like, what is that? And I started explaining all of that and she says, oh yeah, I own some doge coin. I said, you want anything else? No, no. I just bought into it. Why did you buy doge? Oh, I start yelling, tweeting about it. And I thought it was a good deal.

[02:46:48] You know? So when you see stuff like that, where people have no clue what they're doing, they don't really understand the supply dynamics, the ownership dynamics and these types of things. And then when the clock stops, you know, they're, they're the ones who get hurt. And then the regulator comes in and the Elizabeth Warrens of the world and they say, see, this is an evidence.

[02:47:06] These guys can't regulate themselves, control themselves. We need to control everything either let's ban it. Or let's just announce that the only three are legitimate. And, and you know, every one of them has to be connected to identity and raw. And I'm just very concerned that that's a bad thing to do.

[02:47:22] And that's why I've been so vocal about this topic. And my hope is that a compromise can be made where real developers come in and they start working on doge and they find a way to create some sort of use and utility for it. So at least it has a value floor and the, you know, it won't collapse. Is it possible for Cardona and doge going to work together somehow?

[02:47:40] Yeah, it'd be a lot of fun. Uh, you know, I, I'm not adverse to the idea of cleaning up the code base, but legitimately whoever comes in be two years or three years of work, you know, cause you have to do real stuff. And that code is like light coined, circa 20 12, 20 13. Well, the interesting thing about Ian, I've got to interact with him quite a bit.

[02:48:00] That combination of humor and extreme ambition, like in the face of the impossible odds is something he does really well. And so I think that's the spirit of Dorsch coin is. Fun and almost like bold, ambitious innovation. And so I think you can't discount the power of that, but where's the innovation what's the, this is step one going to Mars for right.

[02:48:26] Which point? Well, I mean, he came, he came in the same way to a, to rock as he came in the same way with, uh, two, uh, two electric cars. It was seemed impossible at first, but you step in and you solve the problems first principles one at a time. But, but I'll tell you a little bit on those because I think he had some trends though, that he was very smart to recognize the case of battery power cars.

[02:48:48] He said, hang on, everybody has tablets and cell phones and these other things. And there's an incentive to make batteries better, faster, cheaper, and charge faster. And that's connected to mobile computing. So we're, regardless if you want battery power cars or not every year, you have billions of dollars of R and D being pushed to force this capacity to evolve.

[02:49:07] And he's just getting on the train and piggybacking on that. So that was a brilliant business acumen to recognize that the case of space X, it was just the obvious question. If every time you get on a plane, you have to throw the plan away. No one would fly. So reusability is like a fundamental thing that if you solve that, you've now opened space up to a complete new class of commercialization.

[02:49:27] I don't see the problem in doge coin because if he was looking for it, then why not look at a real platform actually trying to solve a real. There's so many of them, there he is. He throw a rock, he can hit 15 of these guys and they'd all die to work with you and Musk. Yeah. It's very interesting. I mean, so first I could continue pushing back on your intuition about, uh, electric cars and batteries and so on.

[02:49:49] I don't think it's, it's more obvious in retrospect than it is in, um, at the time I would say, because I would agree with you on the batteries front. I wouldn't necessarily go you with the electric car because first of all, nobody started a successful car company firm for decades, but it was the loyalty, the four guys or whatever it was with GM.

[02:50:08] They didn't want to give them back when they had the lease program. So there's some basic intuition that there is some hunger here, but it's not obvious that you can do it successfully and would relaunching rockets for cheap. That's not, that sounds good on paper, but to do it well, NASA is spending way more money for this.

[02:50:25] And, uh, uh, the Russians were assholes not selling any rocket. Like you said, you have to do it all yourself from scratch. How do you build the team? How do you do, uh, how do you launch rockets? When if you fail a few times, you're going to go bankrupt, right? I mean, it's just, business-wise I would rather build a nap, like angry boats.

[02:50:45] You've got to give him credit. He's got folders for balls.

[02:50:51] Thank you for that. But I don't, I maybe that's what I mean. I think there's not enough first principle thinking on the cryptocurrency side, I think I agree with you on that, but there's some aspect to which the seriousness of the cryptocurrency world is paralyzing. So in some way, the innovation that you spoke to requires, uh, taking risks requires not taking everything so seriously, like being afraid to take those bold risks in the space of ideas, not in the space of financials.

[02:51:24] So in that way, I think that's one pro for Bitcoin is, um, there's room. It's hungry for innovation, but I think Cardona in that same way as hungry for innovation, just because you said with some more rigor and formalism behind it, um, and even the Ethereum has a, has a hunger for innovation. That's where Bitcoin is a little bit more, um, I would say conservative in terms of how much innovating they're willing to do, uh, in terms of the incentives they built into the systems for the evolution of the cryptocurrency.

[02:51:57] But yeah, I mean, it's difficult to psychoanalyze. Why Dorsch coin is the thing that excites you on so much. But at the same time, there's some power to the fun. It sounds ridiculous to say, but the fun, the, this, this idea that, um, you know, the most entertaining outcome is the most likely, right. It, there could be something built into the physics of the universe that makes that true.

[02:52:25] Cause you know, the, the viral nature of fun has power. Well, it's a neural science thing. We liked dopamine. We like these, these chemicals in our brain, you know, and we have fun. We want more of it. So you tend to gravitate towards work activities and play activities that are enjoyable to you. And, uh, it, it is nice sometimes to kind of come in and troll an entire industry.

[02:52:54] Yeah. I can imagine he's probably having the time of his life. Is this the same as like taking Tesla private at four 20? Yeah, I kind of stuff. And it's one thing when you do it with friends and I think when you do with a whole industry and it hurts people financially, uh, and also I understand he hates short sellers and there's, there's some things there and I can't speak for him because I only know the guy from a distance.

[02:53:16] It just, I live in this space and I have to deal with the consequences and clean up the mess. You feel the pain. Yeah. And this results in a regulatory fan, it's like, I'm the guy who has to put on a suit and go to Washington and go and sit in a Senate inquiry and all this stuff. And he's the guy that, you know, just like laugh with his friends about how he crashed the crypto market and how easy it was to do it.

[02:53:36] And that's, that's my only, uh, umbrage about this on the other hand, you know, if it brings a lot of cool, new, interesting things and people into the space, that's a net positive. And so, you know, it's not university bad or universally good. And I'd like to give people the benefit of the doubt. And so I'm really hopeful to see what comes about this recent surge of interest.

[02:53:55] And if Elan actually puts his money where his mouth is and take some of his enormous engineering talent and capital and starts contributing and building something in the cryptocurrency space, be really cool to see that happen. There's a bunch of different technical aspects. I want to ask you about on the Cardinal side.

[02:54:13] So first maybe on the scaling side, what is Hydra? How does, how does hydro compared to other different ideas for scalability? Like roll-ups main trade-offs with respect to security UX, um, and anything else you wanted to, you want to talk about. I have to have a little bit more energy, Lex, come on. You know what I need, I need that Coke machine that you mentioned, the, the thing that converts water to cocaine.

[02:54:38] Okay. To from director Bullock, we'll leave, we'll leave this in. Right. Um, isomorphic state channels. That's a, that's a great topic, right there says, is word salad of cryptographic terms, uh, whether lightening, Hydra roll-ups any of these things. Really, what you're trying to do is say, okay, Uh, if I do it on layer one, it's slow and expensive.

[02:54:58] What I'm going to do is batch something somehow some way, and then do it in a different system where it's fast and cheap. And what I'm doing with that is I'm losing some of the security guarantees of the base layer and admitting a slight higher degree of, uh, of centralization. But then I get super fast settlement.

[02:55:20] I get super low cost transactions and potentially I may even be able to get distributed. Meaning that instead of having the smart contracts, running a replicated system, they can run on a single note like a steak pool and their stuff is different from the other guy's stuff. So you go from a system of, of capacity of whatever it is to assist them of N for the totality of all the stake pools.

[02:55:44] So basically hydro is just, uh, the next generation of that when you have the ability to tinker with the accounting model and the layer two solution is, is co-designed with the layer one solution. So it's like what lightening would have been had lightning been co-developed when Bitcoin came out there would have been special provisions made in Bitcoin specifically to accommodate lightning.

[02:56:05] And it would made it very easy for you then to move inside the system outside of the system and have security properties preserved like availability, for example, or fraud resistance say, oh, you can't steal the money or these types of things where things get really complex. And this is why Hydro's novel over lightning is when you want to move beyond payments to state management.

[02:56:25] Okay. So payments are just, I want to move between Alibaba as quickly as possible as low cost as possible. So for example, I have a micro tipping application, like change tip on Twitter, or, you know, like a video I'm watching YouTube video, like maybe this video in the future and people really like it and they click tip and you get 5 cents or something like that.

[02:56:43] Okay. So that's an example of a perfect payment application and that's great. But what happens when you actually have a rich, smart contract look at decks, or, you know, you want to do a video game or something like that. You want to run that off chain, but then there's some reconciliation on chain that happens.

[02:56:59] So a state channel basically lets you do. But it's a lot more complicated and there's a lot more to think about. So hydro basically just has in its design, a collection of ideas of how to do that. And the current paper is for a single head. The next thing you do is composition. So you go multiple heads and there's a routing protocol between them.

[02:57:20] And then eventually create these tail protocols for when things get asynchronous. So instead of always being aligned and always being available, what happens if they die for a bit, and then they come back and you can create all kinds of guarantees that your funds won't be lost or locked forever, or things like that.

[02:57:35] There's a failure recovery mode for this type of stuff. And basically the idea is leverage what lightning has already achieved with Bitcoin, but then take advantage of the fact that you have a more expressive accounting model and a more expressive programming model. So you can just physically do more and you can put more crypto and tie that thing.

[02:57:52] Now, contrast it with roll-ups are really, that is the saying, you're going to take some thing, batch a bunch of transactions together, and you're going to generate a proof. And then what you can do is whenever you see some part of that history, you can check it against that proof that's rolled up and they're closely related concept of recursive Snarks that you'll see a lot there's things like the Mina protocol or other things.

[02:58:11] And basically the idea is that whenever you see something, you can always generate two proofs, an existential proofs of the coins exist and a nonexistence of a double. So you can always check those two properties and the proof is verifiable and logarithmic time, ideally. So you can have giant amounts of data, but it's very small, the actual professor concise.

[02:58:32] Okay. So they're just different boats for different floats. The advantage of a layer two network where there's actual channels and there's interaction and their service providers is the channels can eventually scale in the collection of things that they can do. And eventually they can become interoperability networks between cryptocurrencies.

[02:58:51] So at some point we could modify the bolt spec and make it somewhat interoperable with hydro. And then what you could happen is you could use it as a bridge to actually do cross chain traffic and send transactions between the systems. You don't really think about that too much when you're talking about roll-ups, that's more of optimizing what you have within this.

[02:59:07] That's not within the chain. So can you, can you elaborate how it's possible to do cross chain traffic? Well, you already have the intermediary, you have the channel operator and you already have light language protocol, right? As you just build a Dex that runs within that system and they can swap assets or you can do wrapped assets.

[02:59:24] So you lock it a low cost, I guess you could just switch, uh, yeah. The same thing, lets you batch things on one. We'll let you batch the other. So if lightening works on Bitcoin and hydrate works on Cartano, you can eventually bridge these two together and create a way of moving back and forth and the same things that make transactions in and out of that network cheap will make creating wrapped assets cheap, uh, at least on the Bitcoin to Cardall side, you can't create assets on Bitcoin, another flaw of Bitcoin that they've never fixed.

[02:59:49] What's your thought about layer two technologies in general? Is there stuff you're excited about? We talked quite a bit about lightning network, hydro these ideas. Do you think there'll be somebody that wins out or is this going to be this kind of dynamic thing that we just keep building different ideas and they all interact with each other.

[03:00:05] It goes back to biology. That cell differentiation concept is you have to build specialized tissue. Do these things. The point of layer two is to extend the network. It's adding a foot, it's adding an RM, it's adding a brain, it's adding a heart. It's adding eyes giving you additional senses. You have ears now.

[03:00:20] So when you add these layer, two protocols like a taller prison was a perfect example of that. We don't have identity at the base layer of Cardinal. It's a real bad deal to do that because China will come in or us will come in and tell you how to do that. We do as you build layer two protocol, that's blockchain agnostic, and then the user can decide when and where they need an identity.

[03:00:38] And then bring that identity into this. And if you designed it right when they bring it in, it's very easy, very fluid. And suddenly the experience enhances everything just gets better. Oh, wow. Okay. Now I can use all these regulated things. They go from gray to green in the app store. That's so cool. Or, oh wow.

[03:00:55] Now I can send to human readable addresses. Cause if I have an identity and you have an identity, we can alias them with some namespace. And now I sent a Lex instead of some, you know, horrible back 32 address structure. Okay. So that's, that's really what you need to do with layer. Two is say, okay, each layer, two protocol is meant to do something.

[03:01:14] Either gives me payments or lower cost smart contracts or interoperability or identity. And then it's a marketplace. So you should have blockchain agnosticism with your layer two solutions. And so you can mix and match and choose whichever collection of services you need. And that's actually how it works these days with microservices and these other things and cloud software, you know, every firm is an aggregation of dozens of providers.

[03:01:38] And basically that composition of them is your software stack jumping around back to proof of work. What are non-interactive proofs of proof of work? And I P O P O w S it's fun to say, right? And it's just one of those things that you notice that certain proofs of work when you solve them, come up less frequently than other ones.

[03:02:02] And just by that nature, uh, you can sample them and then construct proofs from them. So you can, with this, with that, just set, have a more concise representation of an amount of work for a range of the chain. So that works again, say that we're the salad, basically the idea is, okay, so let's say that this block, and I'm just simplifying the concept a lot, this, this block, you know, you get a regular green type of proof of work and then this block, you get a green and you keep going and then suddenly you get a red one.

[03:02:30] Okay. So it's still a valid proof of work, but it's more rare than the other ones. Yeah. Okay. So if you notice that particular pattern, what you can do is you can just start not caring so much about the green ones and you can just bookend your chain with red. Okay. And then you can just repeat that and repeat that repeat, and you can collect, you can create this really compressed represent.

[03:02:50] Of these things. So what does it mean? It means that suddenly when you have that, now you have a way of representing a long range of history with a very small proof. So you can use it for light wallets and you also could use it for, uh, side chains if both such has used proof of work. So when you see a transaction, come in, you don't have a copy of the spa, the side chain, but you have a copy of the proof of work.

[03:03:12] And it has the same algorithmic weight as the numeral longest chain. You don't because you don't have all the greens, but the reds only occur was a certain sampling frequency. So this is the brainchild of DNS is Windrose and Aguilar. And it's just an amazing paper. And what's, what's so cool about it is it doesn't require any structural changes to proof of work.

[03:03:31] It's just something you noticed as an off gas, a proof of work. It's like you're watching an engine operate and you notice like every 500 times a piston will do a certain weird thing. And so you take advantage of that. You say, well, if I count 10 of them, now I have 5,000 pistons strikes as I observed that pattern.

[03:03:48] So it's the same concept there, and it's just a property of the engine. So you don't really need a hard fork at end. It's just there. And because you can build proofs that way. Now you can use those proofs to do like clients and you use those proofs to do other things, because you can just use that as something that comes with the history, you don't have to have the whole blockchain.

[03:04:05] It was just a weird property of multiple proof of work chains to be key to the particular consensus algorithm. But usually there's some, some portability in this type of thing, like we're right now exploring, can you do NEPA pals with prism or any of these Charlotte proof of work protocols, but it looks like you can, the closely related is log space mining.

[03:04:23] So you can use this concept. And instead of having the entire blockchain to be able to mine, you can use a compressed representation of it. And we wrote a paper called log space mining. That basically explains how to do that. So your miner only has, uh, these, this very small micro ledger as opposed to the entire ledger.

[03:04:40] How does it connect back to the entire ledger? How does the 'cause because you have those red blocks, you have those special things. And so you, so you know that the state you're working on is actually legitimate. Right? Okay. So the map is, it goes both ways. Yup. Wow. That's really interesting. Yeah. And Dennis is a genius.

[03:04:58] He's a really, really smart kid and he got his PhD under us. He went to university of Athens and he was a alkalosis graduate student. And now he's doing a postdoc at Stanford under Davis. She, and this is literally the only thing he does. He's does interoperability side chain stuff, NEPA pals, and so forth.

[03:05:14] And he's written a lot of great papers on it. And that was a testimony to hard work for getting the paper published because the paper came out in 2016, but I think it took three or four years for it to go through peer review. He kept trying to push it one conference after rejection, after another rejection, but he got it through real proud of that kid.

[03:05:32] And then he's just doing all this beautiful derivative work now, like log space, mining and so forth. So Reddit and you sentenced to starts with Reddit. You know, it's going to be fun. The top question on the Cardona subreddit, which is quite a wonderful place by the way, was can you get Charles to play devil's advocate against Cardinal?

[03:05:56] If it's going to fail, what would a failure look like? And what are the most likely reasons it would fail? Okay, well, there's the failure. Uh, for example, I said one of the project goals was to achieve self evolution. So if it doesn't achieve that where it can evolve itself, iteration by iteration, uh, then obviously the product didn't do what was intended, right?

[03:06:19] If it continuously require the supervision of custodians in order for it to succeed, the system just won't work. The good news is we have a lot of data showing the opposite. Uh, you know, we used to run a federated model and now we're completely decentralized for block production, but that didn't just happen overnight.

[03:06:36] I mean, there was a whole process with the instead of ice Testnet and the staple pioneers program and the launch of Shelly and the detrimenting of the decentralization parameter, and every step of the way people showed up and had to do things. And we went from several to thousands of people who are regularly maintaining the infrastructure, but there's no guarantee that that would be sustainable and there's no guaranteed.

[03:06:59] The next step, the smart contract step will achieve what we want and the next step, the governance step will achieve what we want. I mean, it's an experiment and all these types of things, all cryptocurrencies, all companies are in a sense experiments when they are evolving the business model. And as our case are our businesses systems and society, we're offering to the world of vision of how to run humanity in a different way.

[03:07:22] And the only way the system can do that is by millions of people. Joining the system itself, evolving the system and growing it in that particular direction. Another failure scenario would be the system evolves in the wrong direction. So it's self evolving, but it goes into a more centralized dystopian, uh, way.

[03:07:39] And that's that's problematic as well. What would that look like? What would dystopia that self evolution towards dystopia look like a small group of actors have total control over who gets to use the system and how they get to use the system. And your use of the system is monitored and shared with that small group of actors.

[03:07:56] So social credit, China's a great example of that. A small group of people have access to that. And then your experience in Chinese society is determined by it. So that's an example of a failure mode, uh, and another could be just network effect. Uh, we L we start experiencing a churn rate. Okay. The, you know, inputs don't match the outputs in that.

[03:08:17] Uh, you lose more than you gain and then over time the system dies off. However, that's really hard in practice. Once you reach a certain network effect, even if you become stagnant stale, you tend not to lose your users. And our evangelism is unbelievable in the Coronado community. I think we're number one for tattoos, you know, and that's, if you think about that as a strange metric to have, but there are brands that associate that way, like apple and Harley Davidson and so forth, people tend to actually tattoo the logo.

[03:08:45] Those people don't leave. They don't actually walk away from an ecosystem they're fanboys to the core. So there's a, there's a lot of, of people that are here for life. They don't care if it's a dollar eight, a 2 cent data, they believe in the mission, vision, and value of what we wish to achieve and they've become evangelist in that respect.

[03:09:03] So the question is, does that community sustain itself and also does that community not make the same sense of mistake of Bitcoin, where they become toxic and maximalist, and they start becoming highly religious about whatever beliefs they have. My hope is our community will be open and Socratic and love the scientific method and be willing to entertain ideas without adopting them and discard ideas that are proven to be wrong.

[03:09:28] If we become dogmatic and embrace an orthodoxy, that is a counterproductive innovation, then it will stall out the ecosystem. And you'll notice I never said price in any of this. I never said, Hey, you know, failure is, if the price goes way down and successes, if the price goes way up, that's unfortunately the metric that most people use, but I couldn't care less about it because you know, the reality is if you construct a system.

[03:09:51] The compass is the entire globe and has billions of users. It's probably going to be a pretty valuable system. That's a, you know, a secondary thing, you know, it's an after effect of having success and adoption use and utility. Um, unfortunately most people aren't Reddit and Twitter at other channels. They tend to just judge your entire success.

[03:10:10] Based on that. I had very few people when Shelly launch, even though it took us four years to get there, a lot of work say congratulations on Shelly. But I had a lot of people wanting to reach the dollars. They were so proud of you, amazing work, congratulations, and so forth. And that's probably the most disheartening thing about, uh, the, the, the whole being around and doing this stuff where all the things you do only matter as long as it's making someone else rich.

[03:10:34] And, and in a way I feel almost like a failure, uh, you know, cause that that mindset means that we haven't yet inculcated the community in a proper way saying, Hey guys, this is about more than money. It's about more than the value of ADA. What we're attempting to do here is re-engineer the way society works.

[03:10:52] I'd like your voting to be different. I'd like your property to be different. I'd like you on your cell phone to have a universal wallet. And when you go to Starbucks or wherever. Buy your coffee was silver or gold or airline miles or something like that. And they get paid, whatever the hell they want to get paid.

[03:11:07] And I want those rails to be done with a system that puts you in charge, not someone else. And they said, yeah, that's all fine. And great. As long as eight is $5, we're, we're all happy. You see. So that's a problem. There are, of course, other things that could fail, like, you know, we could lose project cohesion, lots of people could quit and die, but again, there's so much momentum.

[03:11:25] There's so many things here. The ideas are already out there and there's no intellectual property. You know, when you publish a hundred papers, you read a million lines of code. That's something, and it's permanent and it's in the commons now. So it's just as much yours as it is mine. So there's no notion that somehow, you know, if the core development company disappeared, then that concept is lost forever.

[03:11:46] Like for like the library of Alexandria burning to the ground, it's it's there and someone else will take it, fork it and get it done. I mean, first of all, that's fascinating. The self evolution, you don't know which trajectory that's going to take, but also there's could be single layer, singular events like bugs in the system, create opportunity to hack the system.

[03:12:09] Is that something that you see as a potential, a failure case? Yeah, it's always a possibility bugs can exist. There can be flaws in the protocol design Z cash was a great example of that, where there was a subtle flaw and it damaged the fidelity of the cryptocurrency in ways. No other cryptocurrencies ever experienced.

[03:12:26] Normally when you have a bug, the bug, you can see it like the Bitcoin overflow, the value overflowing today. Yes. Bitcoin can be created, but we can verify they weren't. So the monetary policy is preserved when you have a bug with a private system, Lexi cash, and it exists on the shielded side. There's no guarantee unless you can audit the total supply inside that field, that side, my understanding is you can't that somebody didn't exploit the bug and create trillions of these coins out of thin air and just hiding them on that system and tripping them out.

[03:12:53] And so the monetary policies for every damage, as a consequence of book like that, it's probably the worst type of bug you can have for these types of products. So, you know, no matter how good of a job you do, they have great scientists. There are great people. They're great engineers there. You can always have something like that, seep its way and leak its way in and that lurks in the distance.

[03:13:12] But you know, if that's a problem shared with every one of your neighbors, it's true. You know, it's like everybody working on a nuclear power plant. Well, yeah, you can all die of radiation poisoning. Well, we all kind of knew that didn't weigh, you know, so yeah. So it's like, I, I don't really think too much about it.

[03:13:28] You know, I think the context of the question was more, what is Cardinal specific over Ethereum or Bitcoin or any of these other things and yeah. Okay. Existential lurking bug could happen. It's lower probability for us than the other systems because we use formal methods and we use peer review inside the, uh, the, the protocol design.

[03:13:45] So there's been more eyeballs and tools and techniques used to check things. And we actually have discovered a lot of weird wonky bugs before production and resolve those bugs. So shows you the system works. It's a lot of fun. What about. Close kind of competitors. I don't know if you would put it that way, but if you look in the space of ideas, uh, competitor cryptocurrencies, like polka dot, what are some interesting difference between Cardona and polka dot technically philosophically historically?

[03:14:14] Is that something you think about when you think about the future of, yeah, I bet we do. We actually have a whole group of people that do business intelligence and comparative analysis, and we're getting to a point where we want to start eventually forking their code and running private versions of it.

[03:14:28] And just playing around with things, getting better understanding is it, is it consensus actually does this, they actually did it with Yos and it wrote this lovely report, like trashing EO saying, Hey, by the way, all those claims, these guys made are just not true. Uh, but you know, it's nice to do that. It's nice to use your competitors technology or, you know, competing protocol technology.

[03:14:47] Cause you learn a lot along the process. It's not all bad. You know, there's always something there because they have different trade-offs and customers that potentially are more interesting. Like right now we're grokking. How do we want to do the side chain model of Cardinal? Polka-dots actually a tremendously useful piece of infrastructure for that conversation because they copied part of our infrastructure.

[03:15:06] You know, Gavin's a trained computer scientist, he got his PhD from, uh, York and he read our papers obviously. And he realized that, or Voris was a really good starting place for building a proof of stake system. So polka-dots consensus is very similar to ours. And so if you're saying, Hey, how do you do a good side chain model with proof on horse style, proof of stake?

[03:15:26] Well, we already have this pair of chain thing. Right? And so, so now by just looking at that, I can kind of get an idea of how one way of doing it. And so that's just beautiful that we live in a space where that's there, it's open source and it's really good. You just say, okay, well we'll just take that and adopt that.

[03:15:41] There's no shame. You know? Um, the other side of it is that polka dot really has focused a lot on commercial adoption, Silicon valley adoption, getting real use and utility, I say in a much more sustainable way than Ethereum has focused on SERE theorem was kind of a spray and pray thing. Focus. It was more of like, Hey, let's, let's go ahead and actually curate our ecosystem more carefully.

[03:16:05] We're going to build it in a way where there's predictable or as predictable cost as possible with the rollout of the infrastructure. And you know, that that's so important for a business it's not necessarily important for an experiment or a startup where, you know, they're just trying to get population as quickly as possible.

[03:16:22] We'll figure out later. But if you're actually sitting here saying, I need to know what my expenses are three years, five years, 10 years into the future, you need predictability there. I think they have a better shot of it than anything as to, or, um, or with currently Ethereum. Now they're the big contrast between the two systems.

[03:16:40] Those we actually have native multi-asset. We have a different accounting model. I think our base ledger is far more expressive. Art rate of evolution was proof of stake as much faster than ours because they're based on derivative work and we already have aura, horse omega and other things there. I think we have a better, ultimately a better side chain model will come because we have something called Mithril for that.

[03:17:00] But we learned a lot from their work. Uh, the other thing is that we thought about governance a lot more carefully in my view, and we have catalyst and Voltaire. And really the key there is saying, how do we make sure that every single person who holds data can participate in the network, that wasn't a high design priority of polka dots.

[03:17:17] It was more fast commercial adoption. The acquisition of customers will come to governance later, and those were just different business philosophies, but it's nice to have a competitor like that. And oftentimes I said that the polka dots like a theorem, 1.5, it's what F two probably should have been.

[03:17:33] There was what Vitalik wanted to do, which was incredibly aggressive and brilliant, but it's a lot, and there's so much execution risk in that plan. And I think they've had like six years of playing around with it. Had they gone on the polka dot road? Uh, they probably would have been a market within 2018 and because they already had the network effect, uh, they would have had years of building on that, iterating that, and they already had a path to it, to all they had to do was just give Elaine she and her cohorts at Cornell, you know, five, $10 million grants, no white would have been the dominant protocol, not or worse, and the proof of stake space.

[03:18:08] So it's really fascinating historically, when you look at these things and the rivalries and what they did and what they didn't do and, you know, gather. I had a chance to have C plus plus a theory be used as the, uh, as IBM's enterprise blockchain. The only reason they didn't do it is, you know, it was licensed GPL.

[03:18:24] And I think they wanted to relicense Apache, if you ever talked to Bob summer while he was there at the time, and he had this amazing story about like these terrible fights where it's like, guys just relicensed the goddamn code, let's figure out a way to make this happen so that we can get this huge network effect of, of being basically IBM's play.

[03:18:43] They didn't do it to create a fabric, you know, these types of things. Uh, so there's a, there's a lot of lore and stories in that respect, but the space is better because of poke it up. And there's a lot of good people there. Web three is a good concept. And, you know, we run into there, people in Germany and Zurich a lot, and they've always been cordial and friendly.

[03:19:00] And it really affable before I talked to you about governance, which is one of the most fascinating things about Cardona, because there's a lot of stuff too, on tango there, since you mentioned, um, some humans in this wonderful story, you did make a video before we talk directed, uh, to me, thank you so much for that.

[03:19:23] Uh, we came from a place of love, uh, but it was basically saying as, as we have been, you would love to talk about the technology about the future that you're creating with Gordano and just the future of the cryptocurrency space. I think you're kind of worried that you'll be talking to a journalist.

[03:19:44] That's looking for click-bait content, that kind of thing, but I'm fascinated by human beings. I think you're all from an outsider perspective, incredible human beings. I don't know about personal tensions, all those kinds of stuff, but I think you're changing the world together in different ways. And I just wanted to sort of give you an opportunity if there's a, in the name of a love and friendship, is there something from your history.

[03:20:09] Over the past decade or so outside of technology and the human side of things that you draw inspiration from, you draw insight from you just proud that happened. I mean, it's like asking Paul McCartney about John Lennon. Tell us about John Lennon. I say, how much do you hate Yoko for, for almost eight years now, it's just been this reoccurring pattern.

[03:20:31] Every interview. Tell us about your time at Ethereum, those six months you spent there that were so pleasant and enjoyable. Tell us all about it and tell us about your relationship with metallic. It's like barely talked to the guy. I see him every now and then, and make every two years we say, Hey, he says, Hey, it's like, okay, maybe 10, 20 years in the future.

[03:20:48] Uh, you know, Walt Mossberg or robo Mo will, will bring us together. Like he did Steve jobs and bill gates. And we can kind of talk about, you know, that was a tense conversation, by the way, the, the 2007 interviews, 2007, Yeah, that was the body language. That was art. Yeah, it was, that was fascinating. And that was a fascinating study humans.

[03:21:11] Yeah. So ma maybe that'll be us and you're like 10 or 20 years who the hell knows the robot versions of all three of you. Yeah. My only point though, is that, you know, it's a closed chapter and it's funny. I was there for six months. I've been building Cardona for years. We've, we've done all this stuff.

[03:21:25] We've been to 52 countries. I love talking about those experiences and there's so many of them, I've met heads of state, you know, Mongolia like Eagle hunting and, you know, being bucked off horses and riding the sand dunes. Uh, we, we we've invented all this new cool technology. That's the space itself is using.

[03:21:45] And we've had a chance to sit on government panels, uh, pass laws, 24 laws in Wyoming. I mean, it's like all this amazing stuff that's there. And it's such a fun conversation. There's so many superheroes in that conversation like Caitlin long and Taylor Lim home. And, uh, there's uh, Al Sherpas, who we already mentioned that I met along the travels.

[03:22:04] Uh, I met Ralph Merkel. Cool. I met all these amazing people along the way. I had fond memories of, uh, by the, you should interview him by the way, an amazing guy does nanotech now, uh, you know, I, I met, uh, you know, I was hanging out with Sylvia McCauley, and, uh, I remember for launch y'all grant, I said, you should really just do a Bitcoin cash style play and airdrop, Bitcoin, what the hell are you doing distributing this it's like, trust me, I know what I'm doing.

[03:22:26] Uh, you know, so it's like, it's like so many great conversations. It's so many great people. And what I've really noticed in this industry, when you separate the tribalism, the maximalism side, there really is a, a love of creativity and building. And there's like, no other industry, like it I've been in many different places in life and here, people just love art.

[03:22:44] They love beauty. They love the unknown. They love pushing things, you know, really, you know, some cases. Not necessarily the most socially beneficial way, but they really love the challenge. Right. Uh, and that has been fun. I wouldn't trade it for anything in the world. The dark side of the industry is that people love labels.

[03:23:07] They love saying this, person's good. This person's evil. This person's a sociopath. This person's not. And by the way, they've never met that person. They've never interacted with that person. And they just say, well, I heard from this person, I read this book or I did that. I was like, oh, so some books written by a journalist makes $50,000 a year.

[03:23:25] Who's looking for a movie deal, say that somebody said this or did this in an unconfirmed way. So what can you Sue them for slander? I mean, so you just let it ride and you let it roll. And if it was just ending there, that'd be great. But the problem is that cascades and people just repost it and they relive it again.

[03:23:43] And again and again. And then what do you do about it? You eventually just say, I'm not going to talk about it anymore. I'm done with it and you move on and you say, you know, what, if it's your problem, it's your problem? It's your reality that you want to live in? I'll be defined by the things that I achieve and do, and the people that we help and the things that we build.

[03:23:58] And, you know, since I started in this industry, I've gotten to a point where not only do we have this amazing company with these incredible people who work at this company, but we also have the ability to pursue amazing different interests. Like I met Ben Goertzel and Ben, and are going to do an AGI project together and of all places for work.

[03:24:17] And he gave me this 85 fucking page paper. He was wearing that damn hat that he always wears. I don't, I think he showers with a hat on, uh, he never takes that thing off. I think he refused, I interviewed him and he refused to tell me the story of the hat. He wouldn't tell me either. I interviewed him as well in Wyoming and, and he had, every time I call him and he like, he'll have his shirt off, you'll have the fucking hat on.

[03:24:39] And now all I can think about is the hat. I wonder what the story there is. I know it's, it's like, it's gotta be it's about, might be the AGI. Yeah, exactly. But anyway, he gives me this 80 page paper and he says, Charles, it's like the culmination of everything I want. This is how we're going to do AGI. And I said, that's crazy, Ben.

[03:24:54] And I said, I'll, I'll throw some money at it. So we're going to hire some developers. And I have no idea where it's going to go, but I mean, I get to hang out with Ben courts, you know, that's, that's fun. That's the kind of stuff. And that's the really cool side of the space. And, uh, it's, it's what I enjoy, uh, in the Vitalic rival the thing, the Ethereum thing, uh, you know, I try my best not to mention it.

[03:25:14] I hate the fact that it's still when Bloomberg or anybody else writes a story about me. They'll say Ethereum. Co-founder like, can you say something else? If I've learned anything from the internet, you can't resist that kind of stuff. You just have to see Ilan. It's the joke, joke it away. I've noticed this, this is already starting to happen with me is like people just make up stuff.

[03:25:34] They haven't made up anything interesting yet, but they could. And I've seen that with bill gates, for example, just stuff being made up. I mean, probably half of it is true. Sorry. I'm sorry. But like, you know, I guess what I realized this is the dark side of memes is you can just make something up and it'll spread.

[03:25:52] Yeah. And then that's it. And that's, that's, that's what happens. But then the problem is half the world will believe it. Yeah, it could be. So, I guess the hopeless, it balances me, and I tend to believe you almost want to play with that and not take it seriously. Just kind of laugh it off and enjoy life and keep creating, keep doing awesome stuff.

[03:26:12] Right. Uh, operating both in the physical space of other humans and in the digital space with humans and AI systems and just have fun because most of us, uh, in the long arc of history will be completely forgotten that it will, it will be mad. It will matter. It will all be some kind of just like a Hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy will just be one sentence that summarizes all of our existence.

[03:26:34] And, uh, the sad thing is most of us will not be part of that sentence or all of us. Well, thanks for all the fish. Thanks for all the fish. The dolphins are running this thing and they're talking to the, to the UFO's recently, which is very interesting, uh, cause UFOs keep going to the water. So we humans assume that the UFO's are here to visit the aliens are here to visit us, but it's probably the fish.

[03:26:56] No, I just think this next generation aircraft that we're using. Oh, that we're just not aware of, but why are they talking to the fish? Well, that's the place you'd test hypersonic aircraft is over oceans. So it's the Russians with our hypersonic nuclear weapons. That's what a lot of rods from God man rods from God.

[03:27:13] So let me try to transition from UFOs to Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln said that nearly all men can stand adversity, but if you want to test a man's character, give him power. Do you think power and money can corrupt most people? And if so, do you worry of this corrupting force on your own mind? You're one.

[03:27:37] Leading minds in the cryptocurrency space. You're the leader of the Cardinal project. You're the king of the rats of the rats. Uh, does this corrupt your mind? Both the power and the money of it? Yeah. I mean, you see this most pervasively with people who inherit large amount of money or title like dynasties, like the melons or the Rockefellers or other people is the worst thing you can do to somebody it's just hand them an enormous amount of power that they're not prepared for.

[03:28:08] Uh, and the challenge of as this space is like, everybody's young and we're all billionaires now. And we have these called followings and do all these things right. And nobody really says no to you. Like, for example, I have this ranch up in Wyoming and it has 400 bison on it. So now I'm a bison rancher.

[03:28:25] Like if, if somebody, if somebody who was like monitoring auditing, that'd be like, Charles, do you have any experience raising, taken care of bison? I'd be like, no. So you think it's really a good idea to have this ranch with 400 bikes and running around, what the hell are you going to do with buy-side?

[03:28:40] Cause I figure out what I'm going to do with these bison. So we'll make a video game. We'll do crypto bison. Um, but uh, you're going to get one. Thank you. I I'd love to, I'm not pulling it, that string just yet. So I'm wondering how you're going to connect this back to power. And so, but my point is that when you are unrestrained, like literally no one can say no, or you, you have the ability to distort reality around yourself and you're not constrained by social, uh, customs.

[03:29:10] It creates, uh, a situation where you start losing perspective. You're not grounded anymore. I think so it's less of a question of, will you become evil or not? It's more of a question of, will you lose so much touch with humanity that you just can't relate or understand people. And then you inadvertently by your actions start harming people, either through the policies that you pursue or, you know, the things that you start building and so forth.

[03:29:35] Uh, so I think the best inoculation against that is to surround yourself with activities that are utterly divorced from your reputation is status. The best thing are animals and gardening. Cause you know, a donkey doesn't care if you're a billionaire or broke he'll shit on you. Exactly the same way. And so, so there's a humility behind these types of activities and these things, and there's a.

[03:29:59] Honest work component. Like when you grow hay or whatever you have to plant, you have to actually water. You have to irrigate. You have to actually be there. And if you can't use some excuse while I was meeting the president of El Salvador, I was doing this. So Hey, it doesn't give a shit. Right? So it grounds, it could ask you.

[03:30:14] The other thing is you have to get used to giving away all the best things in my life have come as a consequence of first giving. Like I got started in the cryptocurrency space by giving away a free class Bitcoin or how we learned to stop worrying your love crypto, you did a free podcast right in life.

[03:30:28] If you give and you develop that mindset of I'm not attached to the things I have. And if push comes to shove, it goes away. Usually you get more back. Like I keep we all my ether, I never received any of 293,000 ether at the all time high, over $1.2 billion. I give it to my secretary. I had no idea if it was gonna be worth anything or not, but he kind of got shafted.

[03:30:49] And I was like, well, they don't like me. So they don't like you buy the transitive property of relationships. So you're screwed. And he's like, well, I'm going to go back. And my wife is probably going to divorce me and all this stuff and what do I do? I said, well, I'll give you my ether. I don't know if it's going to be worth anything.

[03:31:02] So, you know, he's still pretty good. Uh, so, you know, but then again, regardless of doing that, I now have Cordato I have this great career. I've done all these amazing things. So I think that's the, there's a single best way of handling power is you have to do things to keep yourself grounded. In case of Washington, he's deeply connected Mount Vernon during the revolutionary war, he was like sending letters, talking about the irrigation ditches and the bar and, and things like that.

[03:31:28] He was always connected to that. And it also develop a mindset that you're only here, temporarily, everything you have is finite. It's going to go away at some point, no matter how much you want to keep it, you will die and somebody else will have it. So you live for the next generation. You don't live for yourself.

[03:31:45] You look to the future and you say, what am I going to leave behind? What am I going to transmit? And then you, in that kind of mindset always forces you to be more. Gracious cooperative and collaborative with people, all these dictators they're egomaniacs and they, they, they could connect to these fantasies and they live for themselves.

[03:32:04] Look at G in China, he's unraveling a power structure. That was what made China, China today. You know, after Mao, they said, we probably shouldn't have another one of those guys. And so they said, let's, let's build something where there's checks and balances. And no one person is going to run the whole show or else it'll descend and regress and we'll have problems.

[03:32:24] And then what he's done is he's thinking only about himself, not the best interest of China. So he's systematically unraveling a system they've been embracing for over 40 years. Uh, and to what end after he dies, the next guy who comes out, even as he is super competent, the next guy's going to horrifically abuse, that power structure, and this same thing happened with the Romans after Augustus, the great emperor.

[03:32:47] Then suddenly down the line, you have Caligula and Nero and all these other terrible embers that just destroyed everything that the Republican, the empire sought to achieve. So, so you have to think for the future, you have to think in institutions and systems, you have to have things that ground yourself, and you have to be fully prepared to lose everything and give up everything.

[03:33:07] After I left Ethereum, I had nothing. Okay. Reputation was damaged, not a lot of money. Nobody really want to work with me. No one pick up the phone for two whole years. It was horrible. And so I was a bedrock and that experience, and now look where I'm at. I built all the way up to that. And so that wasn't by accident.

[03:33:25] It was, I had to surround myself with amazing people. Why would amazing people want to surround themselves with me? If I was this narcissistic asshole who just looks like it's me, me, me, eh, everything would be a transactional relationship. It would be okay, we'll get as much as we can and then run away as quickly as possible.

[03:33:45] Instead it was, I'm going to invest in you and it maybe I'll win. Maybe I won't win, but you know, I'll be the last guy to leave the boat. If it, if they were freezing to death, you get my coat and I'll just deal with the cold, that kind of mindset. Uh, you have to have that. I got that from my dad. He got it from his father.

[03:34:01] Uh, you know, my, my grandfather and great-grandfather my dad's. I grew up Montana and they were products of the homestead act for rough Montana. You know, a lot of people died, froze to death up there, eaten by animals or something, or shot by their neighbors and nobody investigates anything cause it's Montana.

[03:34:18] So the only way you survive is by taking care of each other and being a good member of that community. And if somebody gets big, you feel have this implicit desire to go and give back and take care of the community that you came from and invest in that community. Like I came from the mathematical community.

[03:34:33] I never completed a PhD, but one of the things that I'm doing is I'm going to put $20 million and set up a center to do automated theorem proving. And we're going to heavily invest in lean because I'm super excited about mechanizing math and making machine understandable. I know all these guys who do this work, there's like all these mathematicians and computer scientists and no one pays attention to them.

[03:34:52] And they, they're kind of like the redheaded stepchildren of mathematics and they live on the boundaries and periphery. Meanwhile, they're super passionate and they absolutely love what they do. And if only they had the right resources within 50 or a hundred years, what they're doing can probably come the dominant model of how to do mathematics.

[03:35:10] So I'm now in a position where I have the financial means to take care of these guys. So all I have to do is just call them up and say, Hey, uh, would you like to work with, oh, absolutely. And cut a check and it's done. So the, the interesting tension here. So we talked about ways to prevent power from corrupting a human being that's in a leadership position.

[03:35:32] There's an interesting case in the cryptocurrency space of Bitcoin as Natasha Camada, that's basically doesn't have a leader. So the, the benefit of a leader is somebody that perhaps even when they don't carry power, maintains a little bit of a flame of. Um, I suppose Bitcoin has that, uh, with the original work by situation Nakamoto and the sort of that, even though it's anonymous, the idea still lives on through the community, but nevertheless, the leader is anonymous.

[03:36:08] Do think this is an interesting case study about leadership is for the leader to maintain anonymity. It was a saying from sun Xu, paraphrasing it, the best leaders are felt, but never seen. Yeah. Yeah. So I think that's exactly right. The less the leader can be in the room and the more the principles of the leader in the room, the better for the firm, because what you're doing is creating more leaders that way you're inspiring the next generation, the next wave, the next circle out to act with those principles, but contribute in their own way and their own flare.

[03:36:41] And so you gain collective intelligence inside the organization instead of just constraining yourself to however, the great the leader could be. The other side of it is if the leaders principles are too strong. So this is the dark side of it. You ended up having Disney with Walt Disney after he died like 20 years, people said, well, we don't do that because Walt Disney wouldn't do it that way.

[03:37:00] Or to a lesser extent, apple is the old, we don't do that because Steve jobs wouldn't do it that way was daddy's gone. So somebody, I think asked you whether you're a clone or a deep fake, and you said that you admitted, you slipped up on video saying that you are a deep fake, uh, so on that to actually a poker playing robot that escaped a lab truth finally comes out.

[03:37:22] But I said on that topic, who do you think of Satoshi Nakamoto? Is it possible that you are in fact the Toshiba. No. Uh, you know, if you, you, you have a preponderance of the evidence, uh, I think the most likely candidate would be Adam back. It's the outcomes razor candidate. And mostly because he's the right place, right.

[03:37:43] Time, right age, right skillset. You know, if you look at the design of Bitcoin, the types of decisions, like the use of forth, the scripting language, that was pretty common in English and European pedagogy in the 1980s and 1990s, it was like an example language for a stack based assembly and like little stuff like that little quirks like that.

[03:38:01] Also he created hash cash, which was the predecessor of proof of work. And just kind of got a chip on his shoulder that Microsoft never did anything with it. So he was probably looking for something he grew up with all of the cypherpunks. He knew of how funny, you know, he knew of all these people. He knew how funny.

[03:38:17] Well, no, because the, the, the code was not good enough. Um, how was a Unix Linux guy? He was a talented programmer. He was a talented developer. The initial code for Bitcoin was developed to look like on a windows machine. You know, Adam worked at Microsoft go figure, and also it was very academic and it had to be cleaned up.

[03:38:36] And a lot of things had to be patched up and fixed if, kind of like hell developed it. It probably had less of the, you know, let's use and these types of things and more of like, Hey, let's build this cool engineering thing and we'll figure out the protocol design later on. It just stinks of an older academic, the initial design of Bitcoin and the initial rollout of Bitcoin, and then brilliant people like Greg Maxwell and others, they came and cleaned it all up.

[03:39:03] And lo and behold, where's Adam, he's like the CEO of the largest Bitcoin development company in the space. Who's trying to keep working on and building up Bitcoin. And where the hell was Adam when Satoshi was. I don't, I don't think there was any overlap or they were both together at the same period of time.

[03:39:19] But I mean, if you really care, you can, if you're, you know, you could even do this. There's a lovely paper written by the U S army. Um, if you just Google like codes, telemetry us army, it's a technique where you can use a ML and a few other things to actually kind of develop a fingerprint for the way that people write code.

[03:39:36] So all you gotta do is take the original Bitcoin source code and the take all the open source repos from around that time period in before, and see if there's a match between those two. Now, if he's really good at creating an alias, probably not so good at escaping the code that was written. So the odds are that you'd probably find a match to a repo that's connected to a real life human identity, or at least a weaker OPSEC, because you know, you're younger, you have weaker op sec, do you know if people have tried that?

[03:40:04] I don't think anybody's actually done it, but there's actually a beautiful paper. It was like 94% accurate the code store. So I've have, um, for various reasons, I've worked with people that work on Stella Amitree of natural language. Uh, And I think it matches closest to Nick Sabo. If you actually do the, the written telemetry analysis of Satoshi's writings to, I missed the allometry as a field, I didn't actually look for application for this particular problem, but so you're saying Nexavar is the closest match.

[03:40:36] Yeah, somebody did it years. I didn't look at if the model was sound or not, but I just remember reading on a Bitcoin talk and the Saba was another one of the common candidates, health, many Sabo, and Adam are probably the top three things that people, what do you think about this idea of anonymity of publishing something anonymously?

[03:40:53] Would you ever consider publishing a paper? You've uh, you've been part of, I mean, the Cardinal, um, ecosystem has published a lot of incredible papers. Is there ever a value to publish anonymously? Well, every paper that goes through the referee process, the authors are ripped off. So you don't actually see the authorship when you submit to the conference.

[03:41:12] Um, so that's just best practice. Um, but the question is, do you preserve the anonymity post-conference and actually I'm not refill the author of the paper. It's a detriment for the deals we make, because the whole premise of working with our company as an academic is that you're going to have amazing co-authors and your work is going to appear in great conferences, great journals.

[03:41:31] And as a consequence, you get tenure. If you publish anonymously, you know, it's, it's like being like, uh, doing clearance work in high energy physics or something like that. It's like after 30 years of this amazing career working on nuclear weapons and classified reactors, you know, you finished and then you go to apply for a job and they're like, so what have you done for the last 30 years stuff?

[03:41:51] It's where is it on your CV? Well, I can't really talk about it. Yeah. Okay. Welcome to community college, you know, so you get, you get really screwed if you do that. So there's a misalignment of incentives in the academic world towards anonymity. Um, and generally it's only done when you're doing something very controversial or there's a whistleblowing type of a component it's not typically done for foundational work.

[03:42:13] And so Toshi was really one of the first things, because like, if there was a Satoshi docs themselves, I don't think it's possible anymore. But if he or she did that, uh, that's like a Nobel prize in economics likely, you know, there's, there's a, you're on the short list for that. And there's enormous accolades that become beyond the monetary incentives of being able to talk to yourself.

[03:42:32] But, uh, be cool if they give a Nobel prize in economics to an anonymous commodity it's been proposed and it was. Yeah. So, yeah, I mean, it, there are a few people in our company that have done synonymous publications. Like the, if you look at the Comerica ledgers paper, that's a, it's not a real name, it's crazy name, it's a synonymous publication.

[03:42:54] Uh, and you know, but that's usually for away work, there is one project we inherited from an anonymous person, which is fascinating. It's called Q Adidas. And it's basically a, an extension of the QED manifesto from the nineties. And the pseudonym is built white. And I think it's some anonymous mathematician, but I can't figure out which one it is, but basically it's a marketplace for deduction.

[03:43:16] So it's like a, it's like this magic machine where you can create incentives for people to write mathematical proofs and a theorem prover and make some money from it. So there's a, there's some cool work that's there. And it's sad that bill stayed anonymous. Cause I think that could have been easily published and there was a lot of really cool things that could have been done with QA is so you did say the success of Cardinals of the vision you have is for you to have less and less power over time.

[03:43:41] So this idea of governance, what's your vision for a decentralized secure governance system. So the first thing you have to do is you got to look at meaningful metrics, not vanity metrics. So what does it mean to have legitimacy in a governance system? You can build any governance system you want, you can have a dictator, right?

[03:43:59] Like Bob is in charge. It's like, whether you like Bob or not, you know, he's in charge, that's not very legitimate. And you can have pure democracy where every single person votes and then nothing ever gets done. You know, county, dog catcher is like a six year election or something like that. So there's a spectrum there between absolute power to one and perfectly a gala Tarion power to every single potential participant inside the system.

[03:44:23] And then the question is, okay, well, how do you even architecture? How do you handle choice architecture on that? So like, are you asking your people about every. Or are you asking your people about a subset of questions related to a particular set of topics, but then they're not allowed to talk about other topics, like for example, are they allowed to change the tax rate, but they can't change freedom of speech, that kind of a thing.

[03:44:43] So the first thing you have to do when you build these types of systems and they get to a certain scale is you have to build some mechanism for people who are interested in governance to self-select and participate, just create a collection, bucket, and Bitcoin, we had Bitcoin talk and Bitcoin Reddit and these things, and eventually they get hub repos and these things, there was a place to go.

[03:45:03] If you were interested and you need some sort of change management system where people who want to evolve the system can write it down in a very careful way. So in Bitcoin's case, it was Bitcoin improvement, proposal and theory. It's the Ethereum improvement proposal. And for us, it's the sip, the Cardinal improvement proposal, but it's just a structured way of discussing how you wish to change.

[03:45:21] Then there's a question of, do you want to do this implicitly or explicitly? It's the case that Bitcoin and Ethereum it's an implicit system. So there's no on chain voting. There's no like five people said this and four people said this. So we do this in the case of Cardona, we're actually explicitly inviting this.

[03:45:37] This is one of the biggest differentiators between car Donald Polecat adios. And these other things is that we're really serious about governance, to the extent that we're actually doing foundational research and e-voting, we're building new voting systems, we're exploring preference voting and quadratic voting and the long and the short is that we want more and more people to participate in voting for things.

[03:45:57] And you just have to start somewhere. So we're our hypothesis is we can bootstrap the system with, uh, the treasury system. So in Cardinal, some of the inflation goes to the block producers just like any other cryptocurrency, but some goes into a decentralized. She now has over a billion dollars of ADA in it.

[03:46:17] So it's a lot of money and that treasury is not on our mind control or the foundation's control. It's actually controlled by the community as a whole, through a program called catalyst. And so all these people can come together. They can submit spending ballots and other people who hold data can vote to approve that.

[03:46:32] What's nice about it is you have a growth engine to improve to two accesses. One is absolute participation, so increase the amount of people who hold ADA participating. So the absolute number of people participating and the other is meaningful participation. So the depth of participation, did you just show up and vote or did you spend hours debating things on ideas, scale, the innovation management platform, interacting with the funding proposal, going back and forth.

[03:46:58] And there's, there's dozens of little things like that. Now my hypothesis is if you run this with enough iterations, eventually you get to a certain critical bass, like over 50% absolute participation at a high level of meaningful participation where you can move beyond funding and you can start actually having meaningful questions about protocol design and improvement proposals and so forth.

[03:47:18] And then what you can do is you can roll out new voting systems and new social structures, and you can let them start voting on training wheels like system parameters, like for example, the minimum transaction fee or that K parameter for the amount of stake pools or these types of things. Okay. Then they build enough competency there and they move up a next level.

[03:47:35] And they actually start talking about hard forks using the update system, the Hartford Combinator system. See, so that's how you voting on the hard fork voting on a Hartford. You can't do it unless your social dynamics are right and your voting system is right. And by the way, you also need a bit write a constitution around the same time, because not all hard forks are created equally.

[03:47:53] The kinds of things that would add support for a new cryptographic, primitive are distinctly different from the kinds of things that would change your monetary policy of the system. So the, the constitution would be written. And maybe you can comment on what is the innovation man. Uh, it's a company. So we partnered with a company called idea scale and they run a kind of a side platform.

[03:48:13] So people are interested, they kind of, that's kind of our version of a forum. They sign up and there's special tools in that platform for discussions that are productive. So they don't have to send it to kind of like truly Reddit style conversations, but they're much more focused around how is your product, uh, building out.

[03:48:28] And by the way, we're going to add more infrastructure over time. In fact, our chief of staff tomorrow has, since she's working on setting up an incubator and accelerator, and we have lots of cool partners we've talked with in that space. And it's the same concept. Your idea comes in what enters the system should not be what gets approved on the other side.

[03:48:44] It should go through some sort of gauntlet, some sort of crucible where you iterate your way through. And there's all kinds of optimizations and upgrades and evolutions and combinations and destructions that occur. And then by the time you get to the other side, either the idea just dies on the vine because it was a bad idea or it's a significantly stronger, far more fundable thing, and potentially even gets attached with accountability.

[03:49:05] So you don't just fund the idea. You actually fund the auditor at the same time, who actually holds the person accountable because blockchain is not a real company. It's, it's a theorial thing. You need a counterparty to hold someone accountable. Who's real for that type of stuff and that type of funding.

[03:49:19] So that's what we're doing this year. It's like we have a whole team of people, partners like governance, live and ideas, scale and papers. We've written in about 30, 40,000 people regularly participating in this. So it's a huge social experiment and we're learning an enormous amount. And then our goal is by the end of the year to have a meaningful percentage of the entire cardamom population inside of it like 40, 50%.

[03:49:41] And then once you're at that threshold, now you have democratic majority of the entire system and you can have a real conversation about, okay, how do we read a constitution for this type of a system, right. Um, and sorry to interrupt. But so the constitution, you know, people still argue about it because natural language, much like poetry lends itself to multiple interpretations.

[03:50:00] Is it possible to formalize some of these ideas that, uh, reduce the ambiguous. Everything is old is new. Again, we were talking about Logix bond back in the day, right? Uh, so, uh, so there's definitely formal languages you can use to express these things. This is why I'm so interested in things like address and Coq and ACTA and, uh, thir improving.

[03:50:20] Cause that's exactly what you're attempting to do is to express some, some concept or desire or construction in a language that's machine, understandable and manipulatable in particular, how does the system know its own design? So what is the reference of a cryptocurrency? Usually it's a canonical code base, like, you know, here's Bitcoin core and the C plus plus code is that is the canonical code base, but actually that's not right.

[03:50:43] You should have specifications, blueprints that are implementation agnostic as your economical code base. And can your system know those specifications, understand those specifications and can your change management system be for that? And then can you provide a proof that your client is biosimilar to that specification?

[03:51:00] So that's 10 years in the future, but that's where you would go with that kind of a concept. Well, your, your, your attending towards a formalism, eh, eventually, but that's not necessary for the system in the short term. It's good enough just to have, I know what a winner and say the Haskell client is that, and then what you basically do is you vote on a sip and then once it's approved, then you go and implement that and there some mechanism to trigger the update system to update the reference.

[03:51:27] Yeah. Do you have an example of a sip, a Cardinal improvement proposal? Yes. Like the current benefit pledge sip, uh, 0 0 7. So the and double oh seven. Yeah. Everybody loves that. Yeah. I can change my luggage code now, Alexa. Uh, what is that? So, yeah, so basically, uh, it just has to do with, uh, the pledge was a pledge is a certain amount of ADA that a state pool operator will set aside and connect to his pool in order to be, uh, listed in the registry.

[03:51:59] Uh, It's connected to how much income you make as a pool operator. So if you set it too high, you have a consolidation. You have lots of pools. If you set it too low, what'll happen is larger. Pools will tend to fragment and actually run multiple instances of themselves. And so this is delicate parameter that you have to tweak.

[03:52:18] And so we have a formula for it. Our formal specification that's quite involved. And so one of the community members came and said, well, we think we can massively simplify this, this design and actually get a better result for smaller stake pool operators. 6 0 7. And there's actually a lot of conversation and people are thinking about it.

[03:52:35] And it was just stunning for me because to understand how to write a sip like this, you actually have to read like a hundred pages of mathematical pros and the formal specification. So the guys who wrote, I was like, fuck, yeah, this is great. That's an example of a sip of the that's one thing, but it can be as big as, Hey, I want to add like quantum resistance to the system.

[03:52:55] And here's how you do that. You know, like quantum VRF and I want to put XMS and all this other stuff. So there's a lot you can do and you can do it in tr you can do it indirectly or implicitly where there's some social process outside of the system where you eventually approve sip, or you can do it explicitly where you directly vote or some representative democracy, some group of representatives directly votes.

[03:53:19] And then once you've decided it's there, the constitution is necessary because you need to know that the decision threshold is it super majority or majority. And also the voting process, like a lot of policy experts believe that as Brexit was a multi-stage vote, it would have never passed because what people would have done the initial stage and all the horrors of Brexit would have been broadcasted society.

[03:53:39] And there would have been some reluctance and buyer's remorse on it. And then the second round would have failed or something like that. But because it was just a single event, you know, it's like they, they passed it now. British are all passive aggressive about it with no sign, very well. We shall remove from Europe.

[03:53:55] And so, so your voting system has a lot to do with, you know, the outcome you get. The other thing is, you know, what type of voting is it just an absolute, or is it preference voting like, and so, you know, you pick your favorite sip, follow your second favorite sip or something like that. You know? So Congress, airport are two examples of the rank choice.

[03:54:13] I love them so much, especially for political diversity, because it's this whole concept of throwing your phone away. If it's Alice or Bob, you're always going to get itself parked at, at best, right? The giant, uh, charge versus I forget what to do, do short term versus tour itself park. Uh, so if it's ranked order or preference voting, you never have that situation because you always pick your favorite and you get a lot more diversity on the ballot, but then you have arrow's paradox and all these other things that come up.

[03:54:41] So it's, there's no perfect system. And really, you have to be comfortable with governance in a game of. And you start by some guiding principles. And the guiding principles is more, is better and productive interactions are better than destructive interactions, and you have to be able to quantify those things.

[03:54:58] As long as you have an engine that allows you to grow in those directions, then you have a lot more people along for the ride. When you actually start talking about these bigger and bigger things. The other challenge was that we had to decentralize development of the protocol and the brain of the protocol.

[03:55:12] We have fully decentralized the brain of the protocol. The peer review academic process means that there's now an academic incentive for graduate students, post-docs and professors to spend enormous amounts of time writing papers in our ecosystem because they want tenure, you know, they want to, and we showed that you can get it.

[03:55:30] There's been a lot of people who've gotten great academic careers from working with us. So yeah, keep adding to that pile of 105 papers. This is great. And that doesn't need Charles Hoskinson it doesn't need IHK funding or anything like that. The rhyme we're already seeing unfunded derivative work from people that are completely disconnected from us, writing papers about stuff in our ecosystem.

[03:55:49] So just continue to develop that, but that's looking good decentralized development. We're working on that as well. Our goal is sometime in the next few years to make sure there's at least three independent clients. So three completely independent to have teams and code bases, and also to get a separation of the commercial clients from the reference code and turn the reference code in to like a formal specification, a formal blueprint, and then have that change management be completely decentralized.

[03:56:15] The core developers are actually voted on and you know, the sip process is used to change that. And then some way of proving that your client follows the specification as a use of the protocol. Is there beyond the Cardone ecosystem, uh, these ideas of distributed governance. Do you see ways it could revolutionize.

[03:56:39] Politics governments. Oh yeah. Like Ethiopia deal, for example, uh, you know, we have 5 million people that we brought in with the did system there. That's going to follow them throughout their whole life. Right. In other high school students. But when they're in their twenties, thirties, they're going to want to use that for e-voting and for payments and so forth.

[03:56:57] Can you describe the Ethiopia project? Because that's fascinating. Yeah. So we spent four years in Ethiopia. I went there in 2017 and shook a lot of hands, kissed a lot of babies and they said, oh yeah, we'll have it all done in six months. Everything is a lot of fun there, but it takes a little bit longer than you you'd think to get anything done.

[03:57:14] And that's okay. I really love Ethiopia. It's a beautiful country. Um, so we spent four years, we trained a whole cohort of developers. And then we started a relationship with the ministry of education and they care a lot about proper credentials. One of the biggest problems they have is when someone graduates, it's really hard for them to prove the quality of the credentials that they have.

[03:57:34] And it really hard for them prove the knowledge that they have. So if you want to be an ICT outsourcer, how does a, you know, somebody know that this is a real program or how does somebody really know that it's a real doctor or whatever the hell you're outsourcing. So they said, can you come and build a digital identity system for credentials?

[03:57:50] So every student in the country, at some point we'll get a dead decentralized identifier, and then you can prove all sorts of things about them like GPA or what particular diploma they hold, or blah, blah, blah. And then the beautiful thing is the way we designed it is it's extensible to include payments extensible to.

[03:58:09] Proofs about themselves. Like, are you over the age of 21, that kind of stuff. And then eventually it could be used to Lincoln to a cryptocurrency system. In this case, we built it for Cardinal. So a taller prism is the framework we're using for it. Every student will get one and then those students will be able to use those credentials in the Cardinal ecosystem eventually for defy, like lending and so forth.

[03:58:29] So it's the largest blockchain deal of its kind. And it probably will grow to 20 million people over the next 24 months. The other beautiful thing about Ethiopia that people don't know is the prime minister is a cryptographer he's in his like forties, fifties, young guy. And he could actually read the papers we write.

[03:58:45] And so he's really bright guy and he's written this beautiful agenda called digital Ethiopia, 2025. And one of his things in the agenda is digital identity. He wants every person in the country to have a digital identity by 2025. And he wants to implement an e-voting system at some point for that. So when you ask about governance, all of these governance tools that we're constructing for Cardinal are completely reusable for a nation state accompany.

[03:59:12] And by the way, if you create a carnal application, will eventually be reasonable for you because if you have a defined protocol, you need a voting system. Why the fuck do you have to reimplement that native multi-asset? Anything that works on ADA works with the native multi-asset. I can, you can use our voting system for your asset.

[03:59:27] So you could have a government in a box that you could parameterize any way you want. And similarly, when a government does something with Cardinal, not only do they get all this amazing infrastructure, but wait, there's more, they actually get this amazing voting system that they can use for smaller, large scale decisions that they want to do on the U S side.

[03:59:45] Uh, we're thinking about trying to roll something like this out in the state of Wyoming. You know, there's been tons of laws that are passed. It's very friendly crypto place. The very least it'd be fun to see if we can do the Republican Democrat primaries with preference voting and voter registration this way and do it and do it completely online with an e-voting system.

[04:00:03] So, you know, that's something we'll be pursuing in 2022. I think there's some openness to that. Yeah, that's the one good thing about the craziness of Trump he's made like half of America think the election system is completely air parently broken. So, you know, you walk in, it's like, we're going to go kill dominion and they're like, yay.

[04:00:19] That's great. Let's go do that. Whether you believe that or not, uh, you know, it created a market opportunity, created a lack of faith and credibility in the system to improve, to improve this. Exactly. Exactly. What do you think about El Salvador becoming the first country to approve, um, a cryptocurrency Bitcoin in this case as, uh, as a legal currency and w where's this trend going, first of all this event, if we've mentioned the Bitcoin conference, the Bitcoin folks believe that this is a monumental event, do you think this is a start or something?

[04:00:49] Well, they're both right. The critics and the pro people. Um, so the critics are saying, this is a nothing burger, and it's just a publicity event for El Salvador. And then the people say that this is the most monumental event they may actually be, right? Because there's reciprocal agreements when a country issues, a currency, other countries honor that usually, and it trades on Forex exchanges.

[04:01:09] So if Bitcoin becomes a recognized currency of a country, then it may be the case that United States and European union or others can't actually stop them from trading on Forex exchanges and being treated as a currency from a regulatory perspective. So it was like a really clever backdoor into the, the, the league of nations.

[04:01:28] Uh, and actually we had this crazy harebrained idea years ago, we were down in Mexico at the Satoshi round table and we're like, Hey, let's go buy a country. Let's go, let's go to Tuvalu and get them to do something with crypto currency because they sell everything in Tuvalu, like the.tv extension and their fishing rights, and Taiwan pays the money to recognize them and so forth.

[04:01:48] So I'm like, man, maybe we can convince Tuvalu to do something with crypto, uh, that didn't work out so well. But, uh, but now El Salvador's actually playing the game and that's a real country. It's got like 5 million people and so forth. So we know the president's brother and, uh, we've had some conversations there.

[04:02:03] So maybe we'll go, you know, the next few months and see what's going on there and do a state visit and talk to the president. But it's a, it's an interesting development. And it's one of those things that it can't quite be ignored because a nation states doing it. On the other hand, you have to manage expectations.

[04:02:18] It's the central bank taking a position in Bitcoin, you know, are they actually switching over to a cryptocurrency as their unit of account? Um, are they now getting off of BIS and they're all are using the settlement rails of central banks, are they actually blockchaining the entire country and they have some broad, ambitious agenda to go and do all that that remains to be seen.

[04:02:38] And so it really is a commitment there. The other thing is that if you're autocratic, um, these systems are not so good. Because the minute you adopt these types of systems, you're pushing a lot of power to the edges. So there's a world of difference between optics and actual commitment and actual commitment is I'm prepared to accept the consequences that the state is going to lose a lot of power along the way.

[04:03:01] And the problem is it's not clear to me some of these politicians who are pro blockchain and I'm not making a statement on El Salvador in particular, I'm just saying in general are fully aware of that reality. A lot of them seem to think that somehow they can contain the blockchain genie in the bottle and blockchain their whole country, but, you know, stay president for life that doesn't work.

[04:03:21] He wants to have that part of their gone. Did you think once they realized that this is one of the, one of the failure cases, one of the things that people are concerned about is governance, banning cryptocurrency, well that's China case, right? They, they started realizing this was a legitimate threat to capital controls and to the autocratic system that they've constructed there.

[04:03:38] And then suddenly China is starting to build its own people's bank of China, blockchain, and Bitcoin is now the redheaded stepchild. They didn't really care too much because it was great for corruption. You could have eight capital controls. And so all the like, well, connected people there's, oh yeah, Bitcoin's bad.

[04:03:53] But then they'd have Bitcoin of their own and they could use it to send money around. But now the governor has gotten very serious about it there. This thing of like, okay, we want to control and dominate this whole thing. And it's a threat to our planet for the digital Yuan to become the world's standard to displace the dollar.

[04:04:07] But so the moment you have a Salvador and just more and more countries say, there'll be a country in Europe, for example, that, um, that accepts Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies Cardona, the ideas who would put a lot of pressure on the other end. So there'll be like this kind of ripple effect. And then the individual governments won't be able to help.

[04:04:26] And eventually there'll be a superpower, like, I don't know, Russia or the United States and, or I don't know, Canada. Uh, so do you see that sort of an inevitable, uh, trend where cryptocurrency takes over the world as a, as a, as a store of value and as a method of. Yeah, probably. I mean, you can do just so much more with programmable finance, you know, transactions in general have five properties.

[04:04:51] You know, you have the asset that runs on the rail. That's what we always think about. And you can transact that, you know, and then you have the identity and you transact that either like one-to-one one to many, many to one or many to many, and then you have metadata. So that's the story of the transactions.

[04:05:07] Like where did it take place, these types of things. And then you have the contractual relationships. So that's the smart contract component. Then you embed that within regulation. So transactions always live within jurisdictions. This is relevant to the conversation. Well, digital currencies take over because those things are right now done separately in a very fragmented and fractured way.

[04:05:27] And they're not completely globalized and so super expensive to hoist up this entire system and automate things like compliance. It's usually a huge part of every bank spend, uh, bank, uh, balance sheet. So when you look at the concept of a digital currency, you're saying all five of those things are. And so they could be like library driven.

[04:05:47] He said, oh, I want to be in compliance with the Eritrea. Okay. I pull up the air train library. Now you are, it's built into the transaction previously. It's like, go hire some lawyers and go figure out the entire code and translate some things. That rod is crazy. Um, so just the orders of magnitude efficiency gains that you get in the increased liquidity you get.

[04:06:10] And the fact that you can now represent all assets with a universal way that financial stem cell, there's an inevitability to the victory of our industry. The challenge is how do we deal with this with the squabbling of superpowers, right? You know, China wants to be the new world standard. America wants to preserve that.

[04:06:27] And the rest of the world is trying to figure out how do we create something that's a bit more fair and balanced. And so crypto comes in and it potentially is both an ally and a competitor to those desires. Because if you do too much crypto, you don't need a nation state anymore. If you do too little crypto, well, you know, it's China or America, you know?

[04:06:45] So where's that, what's that sweet spot. Do you hope that in the process of cryptocurrency pushing power to the edges, to the people that we would be able to alleviate, some of the suffering in the world caused by a centralized power and then abuses of power and corruption, all those kinds of things. A hundred percent, I'm at a very angry video months ago.

[04:07:06] I make a, I make angry videos from passion. I shouldn't drink collects. Maybe you should drink more. I know, right? It depends on who you ask. I made a video a little while. I said, you know, the, our industry is an industry of frustration. It exists because we weren't the industry that charged 85% interest to the poorest people in the world for loans.

[04:07:24] We weren't the industry that charge 15% to move money for, for a maid, sending money home to mom in Manila. Uh, you know, we, weren't the industry that laundered hundreds of billions of dollars of drug money and funded arms dealers in Africa. And all these things are permitted oil for food to exist and so forth.

[04:07:42] Uh, and the people who did these things, aren't in jail. They're rich, they're billionaires. They fly private jets. So our industry is the antidote to these types of things. And we say, guys, we want a system. That's fair, that's it? Uh, and we want everybody to be treated equally. That doesn't mean it's, everybody's going to win.

[04:08:00] It doesn't mean that when you lose, you know, somebody is going to come out of white horse and bail you out. You're going to have winners and losers, but it's fair. That's all we want. That's all we've ever been. There is no coincidence that Bitcoin was created right around the same time as the 2008 financial crisis.

[04:08:16] It's not like these were just unrelated events. They're highly correlated to each other. Okay. I'd say perhaps even causal go figure, uh, and everything we've done as an industry from that moment to today and beyond has been about that, that, that endless relentless desire to make things a little bit less corrupt, a little bit less nepotistic and a bit more open.

[04:08:38] And it's gotten so insane that the have these things in Wyoming called speedy bags where your full reserve banks, they have a hundred percent of their balance sheet is, is accounted for they don't lend. And then you have the people in the banking community saying, well, those are risks. That banking is we're we're, we're, we're scared that these speedy banks are gonna default.

[04:08:59] It's like, what world are you living in? Your, you have fractional reserve sometimes like 2% assets on the ballot sheet. And then you're worried that the guys who actually have a dollar for every dollar, they say they have are the ones that are going to collapse. It's like the 1984 level doublespeak when you see the system and negative interest rates and all these other things.

[04:09:17] And so I absolutely believe the direction course of this industry is, is to make things more honest and fair. And also by its very existence, it exposes double standards, hypocrisy and corruption. Just the fact that it's there because it's one thing to say that, well, it just can't be because of the nature of global finance, there's no way to do it.

[04:09:37] Otherwise. It's another thing to see it there as an example and say, well, that thing is doing it. Why can't you guys be this way? That's why I'm so passionate about Africa because they don't like the systems they have and everybody's really young and they are going to throw all the systems out in the next 20 years and they're going to replace them with something else.

[04:09:55] If we get this stuff into Africa, 1.2 billion people will be living in a considerably better system than the rest of the world. And everybody else will look at that and say, why the hell are those guys so rich? Why are those guys making the money? Why are those guys doing so well? And it's not satisfying here.

[04:10:10] Well, that's, you know, Africa is just better. No, one's going to say that. They're going to say, okay. Yeah. You know? Yeah. It's nepotism and corruption and a lack of transparency in these types of things. So I think absolutely it has the potential to improve the human condition, but humans have to get out of the way humans have ingrained in themselves selfishness and it is a desire to maximize them for themselves and their family and not thinking systems.

[04:10:34] And so we have to evolve capitalism at the same time. And what I mean by that is right now, you're trying to maximize the amount of resources you get today. What we need to do is start thinking about how do we create future versions of ourselves in 2100. And create a resource for that time period. And then the name of the game is to maximize that or balance that with what you get in the short term.

[04:10:55] And then suddenly you're saying to yourself, well, if I'm doing things that are good for me today, but compromising that I make less money. So, so capitalism as an engine is okay, the problem is it's miss parameterized, right? Almost like inject long-term incentives into the capitalist. Exactly. And cryptocurrency space is the only economic system where that's actually possible.

[04:11:15] You can create a token omic scheme. We're doing things that are beneficial for people you'll never meet because you're long dead actually makes you money today. You can't do that in a legacy financial system and so forth. So I think that that's the real impact capital conversation that has to be had as, as you explore these things is you have to talk to people and say, look, it's not about communism or socialism versus capitalism.

[04:11:37] It's not about, Hey, let's donate and save the world or, or try to be charity and make things better. It's all about how do you use the fact that we have a better toolkit to create a different system, a different incentive model, where the default configuration of the system, as long-term thinking and the fall consideration, the system is to get rid of all of these negative externalities that marketplaces have, and judge the success of society, not by how the greatest of society are doing, but, but how the least of society are doing, you know, HDI, not GDP, this kind of thinking.

[04:12:07] And I think crypto can actually be the Vanguard that kind of pushes us there. And the first countries to adopt that are going to be just significantly better places to live. And the people who envy them will force the other countries. Right. That'd be a ripple effect. So when you wake up in the morning or as you sleep like a baby, wake up multiple times in the middle of the night, are you.

[04:12:26] Do you feel the burden of, of this kind of future that's in your hands and not to mess it up? Like a, what is the big Lebowski for life is in your hands, dude, don't worry about them. They're nihilists Donnie. Do you feel the burden of like, cause we were talking about all these, you know, a hundred plus papers and the academic beauty of the algorithms we're talking about, but then there's millions of human lives at stake here.

[04:12:56] I mean, you always feel the burden, especially my own company. I mean, I have all these people work for me and you know, they eat because I pay them. Right. So if I can't pay them, then that's my fault. Uh, so, so you, you, you, you have to, as a leader, you always have to be cognizant that there's all these people have signed up for your crazy vision and you have to be larger than life.

[04:13:15] You know, you always have to be good. You, you don't, you're not allowed to have a bad day. You know, you're not allowed to feel like shit. You always have to show up. You always have to be pushing forward. Um, and so that's a huge burden on many respects because there's Charles the person and then, you know, char Charles, the CEO, and these are very different things, uh, in terms of expectations at the very least.

[04:13:37] And, and so it's, it's, it's heavy in that respect that said, what gives you solace is that you're not in an old. You know, it's lonely, but you're not alone. You have so many amazing people around you that are willing to help and actually take some of that burden. And my life has gotten considerably better when I learned how to delegate and trust.

[04:13:55] And even if people screw up and fail, it's worth the risk because ultimately you're amplifying yourself. The other thing is that it's okay not to get all the way you want to. You want to push there, but make sure whatever the hell you do, you leave something for somebody else to pick up and carry on.

[04:14:13] That's why we care so much about the publication process and open source go. We'll never file. And our entire history, because whatever we do, it's yours, as much as it is mine. And maybe I can only get you 70% of the way. And I'll plop over dead from a heart attack or get killed by an Eagle or something like that.

[04:14:30] Maybe somebody brings the handle. Maybe somebody brings the hast Eagle back and it kills me, you know? So it could happen. They're bringing the William mammoth back talking to George Church about that. Um, the good way to go or the mammoth, I'd rather be crushed by a mammoth because Eagles actually fly you up and drop you.

[04:14:47] Oh, so you won't die. It'll be a slow death. And they probably Peck at you. Exactly. It would just be grievously wounded on the ground. And that equals like slowly devouring you. Yeah. Don't, don't go down that way. I've lost my train of thought. Uh, the point is that you feel deeply grateful, a bunch of people, and then you give a, you delegate and, uh, somebody fights the Eagle and, and other people takes care of that.

[04:15:11] And this, that, and the other, or you just do the best you can. You're in the arena. You fight as hard as you can. You leave nothing, uh it's for home, you could put it all on the field. And then when you go home, you have pride in what you've done. And you know, that you've at least made a slight difference.

[04:15:25] And you know, one person can make a huge difference. Look at Nora Norman Borlaug. I mean, just wonder our whole world teaching people how to grow crops that saved a billion lives over the course of his life, billion people. Didn't starve to death because of one guy it's amazing the asymmetry and the returns on that type of a thing, just for the knowledge transfer of all things and yet not a household name.

[04:15:46] So that's the other side of it. Um, of the burdens, you know, people always want something for something. So they say, oh, if I entered all these burdens, I should be given something. I entered into this space fully expecting that probably the most likely outcome was jail. That's what my dad told me and other people told me.

[04:16:02] And it was because it's like, look at where we came from the Liberty dollar eagled, all these, anybody tries to innovate the monetary system. You either end up like offi or they end up in prison or they end up, you know, nepotistic, corrupt banker or something like that. And so, you know, the financial regulations are not built for rapid innovation.

[04:16:22] They're not built for Bitcoin. There's a reasons Toshi was anonymous. It wasn't because know he enjoyed the analytics. There was legitimate criminal risk for this type of activity. So the fact that I've gotten this far and I'm doing pretty good, that's a win. You know, you take that life is good. What is a productive day in the life of Charles?

[04:16:42] Hoskinson look like now we're getting to the details here, diet. Like fasting or not, maybe coffee, non coffee, exercise, sleep, uh, scheduling like periods of deep work programming. Then the social media stuff that you do, you clearly enjoy being on social media and also live streaming, educating, inspiring the world or getting drunk and ranting at the, at the computer.

[04:17:07] Well, first off you do a wet year in a dry year. That's what prevents you from becoming an alcoholic. So unfortunately the way that schedule worked, uh, 20, 20, it was my dry year. Like I didn't drink the entire year. No single sip of alcohol. It was the worst bus. Yeah. You do a dry year and then you do a, oh, so this is one of the, your ideas about life is you alternate.

[04:17:27] Yeah. You have to alternate, you know, never do too much of any one thing. Churchill never alternate. He just kept drinking throughout his life. He did pretty good. Just, just, just to, to, to push back against you. Yeah. Alfred north Whitehead, although it didn't Churchill get kicked out as prime minister at some point.

[04:17:42] So maybe he took, he was sober, happy in shape Churchill here to let it Britain for 30 fucking years. But, uh, I see why we can't have nice things under this Thompson. Maybe you're onto something. Oh, you know, it's really crazy. If you go to Aspen and see the bar he used to go to there's. I actually met a waitress who knew him really well.

[04:18:02] And he'd go in there like two, three times a day and she's like, yeah, he'd do cocaine right here on the table. And he'd come in with lots of pills and just put them all out on the table and be taking them at different hours. And they were all clearly illegal substances, but we just give them coffee, whatever you wanted.

[04:18:18] He's a great guy. But here we asked the day in the life of Charles I fast, I tried to do intermittent fasting 16, eight long as fast as we did for a long-term Fest was two weeks, which was just crazy. Wow. My God. I was, can you take me through the journey of like philosophically, what was going on in your.

[04:18:34] Well, so normally when I do an extended fast it's about three, four days. Cause that's the sweet spot before you start losing muscle mass and other things start happening and there's people know so much more about this than I do, but I just feel pretty good. And you kind of get addicted to the fast high.

[04:18:50] You have no downtime, you're just going, you never, your energy, never dips. And so I used to do like three, five days, maybe three, four was, was the sweet spot. But then after about a week, I was like, how long do I, can I make this go? And so I started talking to people say, well, Angus Barbary did 384 days. Of course I'm not as fat as Angus.

[04:19:11] So I said, oh, I can do two weeks. So I just kept going and kept going and kept going. It kept going. And, uh, right around the two week mark, you know, I, I fainted for a little bit in a chair and I was like, okay, maybe I should start eating again. But then I was legitimately worried about like refeeding syndrome and this stuff like, okay, how do I, how do I take care of that?

[04:19:30] So my brother's a doctor and I called him and I said, Hey, Willie, uh, you know, I haven't eaten in two weeks. How do I, how do I start eating again? And he's like, well, what slowly? Slowly. Yeah. So the usual routine intermittent fasting, although I haven't been as good about it as I should be. And I used to work out, I don't do as much as that, the stress and.

[04:19:50] Life balance has been horrible the last 24 months. And I've gained a lot of weight and all that stuff, but I'll fix that. But I do try a lot of things. Like I used to call map and I do meditation recently. I started doing photobiomodulation here. You ever heard of that? No, it's crazy. Headset called a V light.

[04:20:05] You saw that picture of me with like the weird thing with the red lights on. Actually it just lights into your brain. It's really cool stuff, but improves blood flow. And actually there's some peer reviewed studies that show that it does neural Genesis. So you actually generate new neurons and things like that.

[04:20:19] It's really cool stuff. So I do that and that actually helps a lot. Uh, and you know, it's, every day is a little different. Um, you get a few hours of like alone time to work, to think. Yeah. Yeah. Deep, deep work is so important. Uh, you know, there's even a book on that, like deep work. Yeah. Yeah. Everyone should listen to his pocket.

[04:20:41] Deep questions is he's awesome. He's a mathematician, a theoretical computer scientist. So those guys really need their time alone to really think that's the one thing I deeply miss know that when you're a CEO, you're the master of the five minute deal. You come in, you talk to people from you, make a decision, you move on to the next thing, the next thing.

[04:20:59] And I used to be used to like really deep focus. You'd sit down and think about something for 10 hours, 15 hours, 20 hours. And that's that. And I enjoyed it. It was just so beautiful to be, get lost into something and just go and go and go. And then you become a CEO and it's like, you never can go and go.

[04:21:14] You're lucky if you read a four page thing, because there's something else that comes up, you know, and you have to travel, you have to do that. So I've been trying lately to have, and actually our chief of staff recommended like Fridays is, do not disturb day. So it was for deep work. You know, you don't have meetings, none of these things.

[04:21:29] And so far I have not committed to that, but everybody else in the organization that started to move there. But my hope is next month that I can actually get serious about that. The other time I'm lost in thought, as I do a lot of float tanks, have you ever done isolation tanks, but. It's one of the most amazing things you can do, you know, you come out on the other side and all your stress worries.

[04:21:49] They're just gone and you have so much productivity and clarity. If you combine that with daily naps, that's the way to go. Yeah. I'm a huge fan of naps. So what about the social media stuff? And like you doing the live streams, do you ever dread those? Do you, are you energized by the. So be because you're exceptionally good at communicating all the different kinds of ideas and being very transparent with the community on those kinds of things.

[04:22:14] I really enjoy the live streams. You know, it's, it's fun. It's never been a chore because it's, it's for them. You know, it's a chance for people in the community who've been loyal and they really love it to actually just be there, ask some questions and I try to make it as entertaining as possible. And, uh, you know, you have your trolls and you have your, your love.

[04:22:32] And it's actually a nice to have a mixture of the two, because sometimes you can beat down for rules, just for fun, you know, that kind of stuff. And I, and I it's grown to a cult following. I think there's like 40, 50,000 people and it's almost like fight club in a certain respect. So I was in Vancouver years ago and I was at air Canada, checking in just about to fly back to Colorado.

[04:22:50] And it's getting this weird vibe for the guy that was checking me in. And then right after he takes my bag, he kind of leans over to me. He's like, I love, you know, and I was like, really? He's like, yeah, I watched your live streams. And then I was flying into London. I was London Heathrow airport, and the passport control guy was there.

[04:23:07] And I was just about take my passport out. And he says, welcome to London, Mr. Hoskinson. I was like, oh God, am I going to jail in London? What is the border patrol guy know who I am? This is, this is a bad deal for me. And it turns out he watches my life. He watched my live streams. And so there's, there's a lot of that in that's so much fun.

[04:23:25] In fact, here in Austin as a Mexican restaurant, just down, uh, uh, close to this place and while eating there, two different people recognize me. And I took a picture with one of them. And again, they watched the live streams. So, well, this anything like fight club, you have to wonder if some of those people are, all of them are just figments of your imagination.

[04:23:43] Right? I would, I don't, I don't have an answer for that. Like, uh, the, the, I could be a figment of your imagination was just proven. Yeah. But honestly, if I was capable of that level of delusion, why the hell don't I look like Brad Pitt. Good point. Okay. So, uh, on this topic, let me ask you about mushrooms.

[04:24:02] You're interested in mushrooms, growing mushrooms. Uh, I believe you are also interested in the mind expanding capabilities of psychedelics. At least you mentioned kind of the interesting place where your interest in non psychedelic martial is my go, can you explain the nature of your interest in mushrooms is a personal, is a business as a.

[04:24:24] That's a little bit of everything, you know, it's just an underexplored area of science and botany that ought to be explored because there's so much cool, interesting stuff there. Uh, mushrooms do so much like there's you have these things called quarter steps and they are like a zombie fungus that infects insects.

[04:24:43] It takes them over and then it will have them kind of get to other insects, then burst out of their head, like a, like an alien and spray spores on them and repeat the process. I mean, even made a damn game about this, the last of us or something like that, that's a real thing. Like you can Google it and see like these dead hands with these fungals dabs coming out of them.

[04:25:01] It was like, holy God, this is crazy. And in the same, uh, same topic, you go all the way, the lion's mane and it could actually help treat Alzheimer's and, uh, treat depression and Parkinson's and regrow nerves and so forth. Uh, other things, uh, they've shown some, uh, effectiveness against COVID, you know, it's just so crazy.

[04:25:22] The diversity in the mushroom kingdom of the medicinal applications, uh, the pesticide applications, you can use it a lot to kind of save hay and trees. There's a lot of things you can do that, uh, combat to all kinds of invasive species and they it's true. There's a lot of cool stuff with, uh, psychedelic mushrooms and there's great book call from Michael Pollan, uh, how to change your mind, where he was really the first journalist, a long time to go and roll in Christmas, work his way through the Johns Hopkins studies.

[04:25:50] But the longest short for me when I read that. Like, okay. Mine expansion is great. But look at the effectiveness of psychedelics it's philosophy mushrooms with NSSR eyes, selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors for the treatment of depression they showed in the John Hopkins studies that they're equal or better in effectiveness.

[04:26:09] And medication is fascinating, uh, for the treatment of depression than a drug that you have to take forever. And this is just one or two treatments, and then you, you desist from it. That's a miracle because there's so many people suffer from severe depression and it's a lifetime element. Uh, and the fact that we have something in the toolbox that we've underexplored is a very powerful thing.

[04:26:32] The other thing was end of life issues. A lot of people get cancer. I've lost people in the family from cancer, and it's so hard, those last two, three months, cause they kind of like have this, this they're in horrific pain. They're trying to find meaning and why is this happening to me? And if you can just give them a substance that on the other side of it, there's a good chance.

[04:26:51] They can come to peace with everything and, and die with a lot more dignity and happiness. That alone justifies an enormous amount of study. And the fact that these things are super cheap and they grow pretty much anywhere. It's pretty cool. Now on the commercial side, you can make a lot of money from mushrooms.

[04:27:06] Um, and I'm working with a company called farm box foods and it's one of the, uh, they do both vertical hydroponic farming. They also do a mushroom and you know, they, they put these amazing labs and, and shipping containers that are kind of like controlled environments and you grow 400 pounds of gourmet mushrooms, a single week off of that.

[04:27:26] And your margins can be up to 30% per year if you're just selling them for food consumption. If you're doing supplements, that can be even higher than that. So it just kind of made sense from a diversification of assets to say, Hey, let's do some stuff in hydroponics and aquaponics and in mushrooms, but the more I do and the more I learned that community, just the cooler that community is like, I went to this beautiful mushroom festival in Cape Springs, down in Georgia.

[04:27:49] And I met this guy named bill Yule, and he's just looks like a Druid. You know, it's just like, like he lives in a tree and he opens up the tree and goes out everything. And I was like, Phil, what are you doing? So I go and I try to study Beatles and bullied in a very particular type of beetle. And, uh, and they mate in the most crazy way, it's like this, this beetle will fuse on top of another beetle and they'll vibrate.

[04:28:11] And if they make the right harmony, she'll meet with them. Otherwise they'll kick her off and you can only make the harmony while you're on a specific type of bullied mushroom, if it's anywhere else, the harmony to it, it's like who the fuck does. It was like 20 years, 30 years just thinking about goddamn beetles and bullied mushrooms, but that's that community.

[04:28:29] And they're the happiest people you'll ever meet. And they're just so much fun to talk to. And there's just so much lore there. That's not discovered. The other thing is there's ton of undiscovered mushrooms. So, you know, you go to my ranch up in Wyoming, go out that national forest next to it. You'll probably discover six or seven new species, just, just doing some gene sequencing and things like that.

[04:28:48] So there's like a, like a gold rush for new things to discover, to treat all kinds of things. So I love mushrooms, love that community. I think there's a lot of wonderful medicinal properties and, uh, everybody there is just a lot of fun hanging out with the other passion is aquaponics and hydroponics, and I got a lot more serious after.

[04:29:06] I go to the supermarket. All the store shelves are barren. And I say, guys, can you imagine if like we had a real big thing, what this would be like, we need to have domestic food production. We need to have resilience at the community level. So let's go build a 40, $50 million aquaponics facility next to every major city.

[04:29:23] So at least you have some local production of food and people won't starve to death. Otherwise it's, it's very bad. And again, the margins are phenomenal. There are 20%, 30%, if you actually do it right. And alternate your crops properly and so forth. And you create a lot of high paying jobs with it as well.

[04:29:38] And so you're kind of draw a lot of value from staying close to nature and all of these kinds of ways to keeping you humble. Like you said, a, what is it? The goat still going to crap on you? Oh yeah. The donkeys will shit on you. Whether you're a broker or a billionaire, that's a good line. That's the one, like, there'll be your, the, the line you'll be remembered for if the universe has a sense of humor, it's a Neo Yogi Berra.

[04:30:04] So, uh, I think mushrooms is a good place to, uh, to ask about my, uh, friend Joe Rogan. So I keep focusing on the Cardona community, kept saying, it keeps saying things like, uh, lugs podcast first, then Joe Rogan experience, uh, I guess, um, the moon and Joe's Mars in this metaphor. Uh, since I'm a CS person, I can talk a little bit, uh, more fluently about cryptocurrency because fundamentally, uh, cryptocurrency is a computational idea, but then there's somebody like Joe, who is more like an every man.

[04:30:36] He does not necessarily know the technical intricacies of cryptocurrencies. What kind of, and I don't think he's had a cryptocurrency person on the interview and race Antonopoulos. Oh, he did that's right. A long, long time ago, but that was almost like, um, you know, the cryptocurrency space goes through phases and I think we're in the new era of some kind.

[04:30:56] Right. And what, how do you talk to Joe about Cardona? How do you talk to Joe? About what the heck? I remember somebody tried to explain to him what doge coin is. Uh, how do you explain this whole space of what Bitcoin is of war theory them is, or Cardona smart contracts. And some of this proof of work with us put the stake ideas that we'll be talking about you don't what you do is you start with applications that they're interested in.

[04:31:21] So he's an elk hunter. And so he's probably interested in elk tax, right? So you start there and you say that whole system can be put on a blockchain and here's how it's going to be better for you. You said that that's what you do. You always connect it to something they know and love. And then once they get that, they say, oh, that's really cool.

[04:31:37] And then they ask, what else can you do with it? What else can you sell me on it? And you kind of work your way. Outwards there from technologists make is they're so damn in love with the technology. They have that tail wagging the dog where they just want to talk about the technology and how incredibly cool it is.

[04:31:52] And it's fun. It's like talking about math all God, let's talk about co-board isms. That's fun. Aria. Like in these everybody's eyes glaze over, you know, you always have to connect it to the interest of the particular person and what they care about, what they love, what they need, royalty payments. You know, he's a big guy.

[04:32:08] He's got the Spotify thing. He's got all these things going on. Intellectual property is probably pretty important to Joe at some juncture. So NFTs, we could talk about this concept of perpetual royalties. So for example, let's say that you create a piece of art. You can build into the token itself, a perpetual royalty to something you care about.

[04:32:26] Maybe a every time it sells, it, pays it back to you. Or maybe every time it sells it donate to some clean water charity or something like that. The point is that the actual acquisition of the NFT requires adherence to that smart contract. So people can't deviate from your desire even after you die. So, you know, stuff from Andy Warhol or from Picasso that that can still be generating some donation.

[04:32:49] Every time a Picasso sells to something else, you can do that with NFTs and starts thinking, God, what else can I do? I do shows maybe I can do my tickets with these types of things. Maybe I can do loyalty points for my fans. So now you've got them engaged and he's thinking of all the opportunities for him.

[04:33:04] And it gives him an incentive to anchor and connect to those concepts. And then over time he starts asking questions. Well, how do we know. Then we can talk about proof of work or proof of stake or these types of things. Well, so this is how it stays secure if you're really interested. And, uh, there's, there's, uh, an incentive to have the attention span necessary to do the homework, eat the broccoli and get over that hill.

[04:33:25] But it's also an opportunity. At least it was for me, especially with Bitcoin a while ago is to take another look at the monetary system, or even look at the, you know, I've been looking quite a bit that the history of the 20th century, and sort of look at that history through the perspective of the monetary system of the gold standard and all of those kinds of things.

[04:33:44] And just add that little layer of consideration of how much money of how money can be used to, uh, by people in power to control the populace. Right? And it's, it's, it's fascinating to look at the history from that perspective. And then that allows you to look at the future of how we can change that in order to empower people.

[04:34:06] And then of course the, the, the governance thing that you're working on is fascinating because, I mean, I don't know, but it seems like deeply broken aspect of our government is just the voting system and discussing how that could be revolutionized is fascinating because a lot of conversations ended up being on, you know, on the internet about like number go up, which is like financial side.

[04:34:30] And then to me personally, at least I think that that's the same for Joe is that's just boring. Like it's the investing the financial side of it. I know it has a lot of impact, but it's kind of boring, right? Cause long-term is not going to have any impact. If the ideas are strong long-term is going to win the ideas a week long-term is going to lose the ups and downs of the short term.

[04:34:52] Don't matter. That's just like, uh, casino games, uh, that you play. Speaking of games, video games got to ask you about those. Okay. Well you mentioned Diablo, maybe you're a fan of Diablo. Oh yeah. Yeah, Darren was great. Skyram was great too. Like the elder scrolls, I actually bought the game that the elders girls was based on, you know, that, so, uh, way back in the day, the elder scroll series was inspired by a game called legends of valor that I played when I was a little kid and it doesn't actually have an ending.

[04:35:22] They ran out of money before they finished it. So they just kinda like put this little thing on and said, okay, but you never finish it. So I actually bought all the intellectual property. Yeah. The, and all that. I didn't know. There was a connection to lunch. It's a valid, I forget the name. The guy was at Todd something, uh, at Bethesda.

[04:35:37] Uh, he, uh, he was, he played it. He was inspired by it. And then he created arena right after playing it. That's such a good game arena. Daggerfall yeah, yeah, yeah. I had a copy of Daggerfall when I was a kid, but it had a buggin. So when you left the dungeon, it would crash. And this was before, like he can get an easy patch for it.

[04:35:54] So I never actually played Daggerfall I entered in through Morrowind. Yeah, no, the Daggerfall was a, the, the fascinating thing. Would you jumping all over, but we'll return to the legends of AXA when I asked you about that. But Daggerfall was fascinating because I think of all the other school games, it was like the largest, because it was, uh, like randomly generated, right.

[04:36:15] It would like randomly generate the worlds, the, the Dungeons and so on, which is fascinating to think about like, how big can you make the world, uh, both in actuality and feel like it's incredible to have a video game. I don't know how many video games do this well, where the feeling is, you can be lost here forever.

[04:36:35] You can, you can live here. Uh, because most video games have like a bottom. It feels like you can run out of stuff with Daggerfall was like, I can just keep doing this. Right. At least that's what I felt at the time. But yeah, why, what the heck legends of valor was the idea that. Well, I mean, it's, it, there's really nothing about it.

[04:36:54] That's super compelling today. I mean, there's a nostalgia of youth that's there, but I'm a Disney would have a class system, a level system. The combat system is terrible. There's no journal. The magic system is terrible and so forth. And so I just wanted to start somewhere and I felt like that would be an incredibly fun overhaul project.

[04:37:11] I kind of got the idea from beam, dog studios when they did, uh, another one of my favorite games. Remember Baldur's gate. Yeah, they didn't to, oh yeah. The enhanced edition was great. They should have never just thrown a ball. They should've done an actual, proper sequel and I got down that whole road. Um, but anyway, uh, I got the idea there.

[04:37:29] I say, well, take some old piece of IP and then you can kind of retrofit it and clean it up. And what's nice about legends of LR is it's a blank slate. You can do your own elder scrolls. You can create your own class system and level system and so forth. You could write some beautiful, exciting, fun narratives for that.

[04:37:46] And also it gives me a chance to explore a lot of things I think should be dragged into game development. Like algorithmically generated music is one example. The problem with sound games, as you, as you mentioned, you play lots and lots of hours, but your sound content is much smaller. So you have tons of repetition in the soundtrack.

[04:38:02] So what if you could connect the music to the state of the game world and it automatically through some process will generate music. And there's actually people who study this, you know, and so that's one dimension. The other thing is you have things like GPT three and so forth. There was a great game, uh, event zero, uh, and it came out like 2016 were, you could actually have a dialogue with an AI, uh, and you're like a marooned astronauts at a space station that's abandoned.

[04:38:28] And you have to somehow work with this AI through communicating with it, to convince you to take you home. Uh, but the AI is a bit duplicitous and I don't want to spoil the plot of the game because it's such a cool game, but it's actually like a paint by numbers. It's almost like Zurich. You don't have preselected dialogue, you actually type in the terminal and the AI will reply to you back and forth.

[04:38:50] And this was 2016 and it's like, things have gotten an order of magnitude better. So the evolution of that tech, I think within the next five years brought into video games. Could you give you incredibly cool dialogue inside the inside of the game? So algorithmically generated music, better dialogue, better game play mechanics.

[04:39:06] Also, I'd love to explore alternative physics systems, you know, alternative geometries, like, you know, uh, hyperbolic geometry, or these types of things. And there's actually a hyperbolic is a game that does that. And you can do down the Euclidean geometry as well, and bring those elements into a game design.

[04:39:23] And that's what we'll do is legends of allies. That'll be kind of like Skyrim, but with a lot of really cool new shit, it's got like I saw Aerosmith years ago and he was out there. He's like, do you like the old shit? You like new shit kind of middle shit. You know? So you're going for the middle. I'm going to try to do some of the old and some of the new and, you know, bring it in.

[04:39:41] So that'd be a lot of fun. Um, and what's nice about it is that, uh, there's a lot of new. Play in the market because of the Microsoft acquisition at Bethesda, they've been losing employees like crazy. And there's a lot of belief that elder scrolls six will not live up to expectations because Microsoft will kill it.

[04:40:01] Tweet. Okay. Listen to me. I will go into, um, I'm all about love on the internet, but I will go hard at you, Microsoft, if you screw up all the scrolls w well, we might have to do a spiritual successor. Right. And it might have to happen with legends of Valerie. You never know. Right. But it's a passion project.

[04:40:18] So I have no time for it at all. It's like so low on my list of things to do. So I'll probably do in 20 22, 20 23, and we'll build a nice crew and we'll do it. Wyoming, probably Wheatland or some really small town and we'll import everybody. And then we'll have to build the whole city up. Like Elan is doing here in Texas.

[04:40:34] It'll it'll be a fun project. Wow. Like programmatically generated music. You mentioned Baldur's gate. I, by the way, Haskell frameworks for that, you Terpy is one for generating music. Yeah. For doing it for one, how successful that could be. Cause I remember Baldez gave was the first game where I realized music is so important to the game.

[04:40:51] I w it was the thing I remembered about the game is the reason that it was the thing I thought about when I was away from the. It's like that the feeling, it created that music, I don't even remember the music anymore, but I remember that music BA dumb duh, Jeremy soul, I think was the composer. Yeah, it was great.

[04:41:11] And actually getting like Robins you ADI are fair McCready end to do that. That would be so cool. Uh, okay. This is awesome. A ridiculous question. What's the. Maybe let's say top three greatest video games of all time. Uh, yeah, Boulder's gates definitely in the top three arcane Kanombe is my favorite game.

[04:41:30] And our K9 was Troika games was just this amazing studio where they, they took the time to build. Probably the, the most compelling game worlds, the case of arcane M it takes place in like, kind of like a 19th century, Victorian England plays so steam punk, but then there's also magic inside of this game world.

[04:41:48] And there's this crazy juxtaposition between magic and technology and the more technology you have magic, stuff's working, the more magic you have, it disrupts technology. So all the people on the magic side hate the technology people and vice versa. And so you're just this character in this game world, and you're just trying to figure out like, where do you fit?

[04:42:06] And, uh, it has this incredible plot where you're, you're kind of just a, a stowaway on a Zepplin that gets shut down and you get dragged into this conspiracy, and you have to kind of figure out the conspiracy as you go through the whole game world, and you meet all these different races, like the elves and dwarves and so forth.

[04:42:22] And they've all been impacted by the proliferation of technology in different ways. Like the humans use steam engines to clear cut all the forest, and it caused a lot of problems. The dwarves leaked that technology to the humans. And so they kind of got exiled for it and so forth. And you have to decide like, where do you fit all of this?

[04:42:38] And you have a lot of choices as a player. You can be on the magic side of the technologies that kind of be neutral. There's like 40 different endings for the game. It's just incredible. And this is all like 2000. And then you talk about a procedurally generated world. You have a quick travel, but if you want, you just walk in the world, rattle the generator, but it's not like Daggerfall where there was interesting things along the way.

[04:42:58] So it was really ahead of its time. And it was kind of the last of a generation of games. It was based on the same framework that interplay used for fallout, the original fallout fallout too. So that was really a cool setup. How were the graphics that were not as central to isometric three? A top-down so cool.

[04:43:16] Yeah, kind of like the fallout look. And so, uh, it doesn't hold up super well today, but that was never the point. It was a more of a story-driven game, but it was one of the very few games where at the very end of the game, you can actually talk the villain into killing himself instead of, instead of fighting you, if you, if you, and you had to really work at it, you had to become a master of persuasion and get your charisma score, maxed out and learn all this stuff along the way.

[04:43:41] And you have this philosophical debate over the nature of life and death with him. It's amazing. Yeah. And then you're just like, by the way, you're wrong. And here's why, and he's like, oh yeah, you got a point I'm just going to kill myself. I was like, wow, this is great. Plain scape. Torment is a, the other one I think is probably the greatest.

[04:43:57] Yeah. It's another one on the infinity engine, which was what was used for Baldur's gate. So it looks like Baldur's gate and God, that was such an incredibly well-written game. You play this character called the nameless one. It was a little blue guy and you wake up in a morgue and it turns out that you're a mortal and every time you die, you lose all your memories.

[04:44:14] And so you've just been apparently living this life for a very long time. And you meet all these people in this crazy city called sigil, who know you, but you don't know yourself. And you're trying to figure out your name, your identity, and why do you have this curse where you live forever, but you keep forgetting every time you get killed.

[04:44:31] And it turns out you weren't such a nice person, uh, throughout this entire game world. But then again, it's this question of, well, if you can start over and you lose all your memories, do you have a chance for redemption or not? So it's incredible game Planescape torment. And it's actually another one of those games where you can, you can never actually have a fight.

[04:44:49] You can just kind of talk your way out of everything. And there's probably like thousand pages of dialogue. And so the game, those guys have a lot of fun and a lot of drugs making that game. Do you think these are the, these three games of the kinds that would still be okay to play today? Or are they forever lost in time?

[04:45:03] Because, uh, because we sort of are got desensitized to the richness of computer graphics and all those kinds of things in modern games and enhance these games because your storytelling medium is so much more engaging. You know, I was at the movie theater before COVID and the person to the left of me was looking at their cell phone during the movie.

[04:45:23] And the person to the right of me was looking at their cell phone. They're just not engaged anymore. Everybody's attention starved. And the video game is one of the last mediums where you have undivided attention. They're really into it. They're all into that thing. And so I think the fact that you have VR and AR and enhanced graphics and all these new game play mechanics, it's a value add instead of a value negative, because ultimately, what are you doing?

[04:45:46] You're telling stories and you're trying to connect people to something. Maybe it's the nature of life and death, or are we truly real? Are we in a simulation or not, or something like, it'd be great to do 13th Flores a game or something like that. Uh, and the question is, well, how good of a story can you tell while you're constrained by your storytelling tools and technology?

[04:46:05] The fact that games are so much more advanced now, it means that you now have many more dimensions of storytelling available to you. And actually with AI now coming in and really good AI coming in the next five or 10 years, your storytelling is not static anymore. The person can actually majorly participate and change the outcome of it in ways that were previously unpredictable.

[04:46:26] The other thing is they're still educational. You can teach people concepts that they never knew before. And it was like, if you want to teach people about bizarre geometries or like Minecraft is a great example, a lot of people learned how computers work from Redstone. Think about that. It's true. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[04:46:44] I mean, yeah, the, we said we're more and more going to be living in a video game. Worlds might as well sort of, uh, as opposed to just make it fun. Also expand our knowledge, expand our ability to think, like, uh, explore different ideas and do education broadly defined within those video game worlds. So we can do the entirety, the entirety of life in, in the video game worlds.

[04:47:08] Hopefully it doesn't look like Minecraft, but we'll see. Do you have advice for young people today, aside from playing lots of video games, uh, you know, high schoolers college students thinking about their career, thinking about like. Well, we no longer live in a world where you get one skill set. You do it for 40 years and retire.

[04:47:28] I mean, that, that ship has sailed a long time ago. So learn how to learn and learn an appreciation and love for learning. So that's the first thing, uh, you know, Josh, Waitzkin wrote this beautiful book, the art of learning, if you ever read it. Yeah. Stuff like that. Uh, so good study skills, you know, slip box notes, these things, what was it?

[04:47:45] Um, Zelle settle Castin or whatever is it? Yeah, there's a lot of little techniques that you can pick up along the way. And basically they teach you how to process lots of information, very quickly retain it, and then decide what's useful to you for that moment. The second thing is do not undervalue EIQ, emotional intelligence.

[04:48:01] We we've lived for a long time in a society where IQ was dominant. It's like how smart you are, excuses, everything else. You could be a horrible human being, but he's a really bright guy, right? The asshole mathematician or physicist. We now live in a world where the balance is far more important. You have to be smart, but you also have to be a nice guy.

[04:48:21] And don't undervalue that. So learn things like closed circuit communication and active listening. These skill sets will always pay enormous dividends along the way. A third. Remember that you're judged for the things that you have and what you do with those things. If you have very little, you still have to do something.

[04:48:37] When you have a lot, you have to do even more. So learn how to. And do that early on. Learn how to give back volunteerism, charity, mentoring, these types of things. Those are so incredibly valuable to a person's develop the people that you mentored in the academic world. You learn that you have graduate students.

[04:48:55] They, one day will be professors and it might just so happen. They might eclipse. You remember Gauss had a doctoral advisor, never forget that. Uh, you know, and so did, Feinman make sure that you mentor people, you give back and you learn how to learn, and you learn how to teach super important for your development.

[04:49:14] As a person. Now you'll notice all those things are agnostic to whatever domain you happen to have chosen. You could be in medicine or law or technology, whatever that's your fancy, whatever your passion happens to be. And don't conflate, you're earning in your career. And people try to keep putting these things together.

[04:49:30] They're increasingly becoming decoupled. There's a lot of cases where people do their passions and they do it for free or, you know, for sustenance, but then they have something else they do on the side to also augment or supplement their income. Probably best that way. When you conflate the two, you tend to get burnt out, terribly easy to sly with musicians or other people know they just, they want to make music, but they have to tour or whatever.

[04:49:51] Cause they, I got to pay bills and stuff like that happens. Uh, other than that, I mean, I, I'm not a guru. I'm not in any particular positions. Yeah. He showed up in a robe. We should, I thought was kind of weird. And yet he had a crown and he kept calling yourself king to get the rats. And that wasn't a robe.

[04:50:07] That was a yukata. Thank you for clarifying audience. He's joking.

[04:50:14] I heard somebody who's going to write blog posts. Charles Hoskinson walks, walks around with a crown. Let me ask you a ridiculously big and the most important question. What's the meaning of this whole thing of like. Well, I've got a story for that. Does this have something to do with a farm? Well, no, no, no.

[04:50:34] It's from Japan. I used to live in Japan. I live in beautiful area. It's like, if you're gonna live anywhere in Japan, live in Osaka and you live anywhere in Osaka, lived next to the restaurant district. It's four o'clock in the morning and get good ramen. These are the things in life that make you who you are.

[04:50:50] Um, so there was a Shogun and it was kind of a bad ass. He is really good killing people, really good at running his empire. And then he got a bit disgruntled in his late forties and he said, you know, I'm just going to give it all to my son. And I'm going to wander around Japan until I find the perfect cherry blossom.

[04:51:07] That's what I'm going to do. Everybody thought he went crazy. He said, no, no, no, that's what I'm going to do. I took his whole entourage with him. And so he had, his son is now the Shogun. And then he's just wandering throughout Japan and having all these incredible, crazy adventures as he's wandering throughout Japan, you know, fighting bandits and loving, beautiful women and so forth.

[04:51:24] And then 30 years later, um, he's passing these two geisha gals and uh, one of them turns around and they noticed him slumped over next to a cherry tree. And so she goes over to try to Rouse him and he's dead. And in his hands is a wilted cherry blossom. So that's a very Japanese story, right? The point is that it's not the actual blossom, finding the perfection that matters.

[04:51:49] It's the, it's the things you do on a day-to-day basis. The places you go, the people you meet, the experiences you have and the joy you take and the things that you do here in the moment. Now you have to get there. You know, if you look at Jiro dreams of sushi, there's this guy, 70 years of his life making the same damn piece of sushi again and again, and again, he's the happiest guy around Albert Camou and his story of Sisyphus and assist.

[04:52:11] If it should be miserable, it's the Greek curse. No, he's happy. He has total clarity of purpose. And every day he gets to basically roll that stone just a little bit better than the day before a different way than the day before. And it's not the destination. It isn't getting the stone up at the top of the hill.

[04:52:27] That matters. It's the fact that the act, you find that joy in that act, that it can guide that way of life. That purpose of life, that I think is the closest thing a human can get to them. Um, you're a blip, you know, you, you didn't exist your debt. And if you compare it to the size of the universe and that time, it's just a little blip.

[04:52:49] So all you can do with what you have is just find meaning in the things that you do on a daily basis. And you can't predict the macro. We have all this wealth and power in America. What if a world war breaks out, we could be destitute like Walmart, Germany. And so, you know, you could be a big guy. You could be now not living on the street side.

[04:53:07] Would you be miserable? The point of life is getting to a point that no matter what comes your way, what misfortune comes your way, you're in a position where you can find an modicum of happiness and love and empathy for others in that moment. And then the highest pursuit of life is the ability to share that mindset with other people and give it to them somehow.

[04:53:27] And that's, that's really hard, you know, cause everybody comes with their always your, uh, doom and gloom instead of yet. But this and that and reputation is that you have to somehow transcend all of it and say, you know, that doesn't matter. Look at the cherry blossoms, aren't they beautiful today? And let's find a better one tomorrow.

[04:53:44] See the you're also a fan of fishing. I've read somewhere. And one of my favorite books is old man, and the sea, uh, where there's an old man sort of battling a big fish and basically closing out the last chapter of his life in this battle. So I think another aspect of life with this Boulder, it feels like the Boulder gets bigger and bigger as we get closer to a, to death.

[04:54:11] And, you know, you, you find yourself married to a particular struggle, uh, in life that eventually just kind of, um, overtakes the entirety of meaning of your existence is do you think, uh, I know what it is for me. Uh, do you have something like that, the broader vision that unites your work with Cardon and everything you've done in life?

[04:54:34] The, the big fish that you're going to end up in a, in the dark of night struggling with at the end of the last chapter of your life, like the big problem you're taking on. Well in mathematics, it was the gold box conjecture. I'd like to prove that's a really big fish. Uh, so do you still have a love for mathematics?

[04:54:55] Oh God. Yeah, of course I do. Um, you never lose that. You never lose it. You lose the ability to do deep work and you don't have the creativity and the raw inspiration. This is why I've gotten to automated theorem proving. Cause what I lack in because I'm getting older, I can now have computers understand and use AI to just solve this stuff.

[04:55:11] It's like the cheat codes for math. Fuck. Those guys will still do that. But you know, the mathematics still has those, those last passions and you know, there's all kinds of cool things that I'd like to see done. The quota complexes allow you to unify typology and number theory and really novel ways. And they're all kinds of cool things, but who cares?

[04:55:28] Um, it's it's everybody has those, those white whales. Another thing I love to do is bring back the wooly mammoth. You know, that's George church's hidden pleasure in five to 10 years, it's actually going to happen. And I had this beautiful ranch in Wyoming and I got to find a way to convince George to let me raise his, his clone mammoth fence on my wrong, the bison among the BICE.

[04:55:49] They'd probably get along really well. And then I have to learn all these cool things about William Amis. Like, you know, do you shave them in the summertime and let them get shaggy during the winter? Or do you just let that cocoa and then fall? Who knows? You're like, it's an undiscovered. I just had, I just had the image of, uh, Charles Hoskinson alone on a bison farm, trying to raise a willing mammoth and start wearing a white suit and say welcome to Hoskinson ranch.

[04:56:13] I have a cane with Amber on it. Yeah. Yeah. The chalkboard that he keeps scrambling on, like a beautiful mind, the movie you'd have voices. The schizophrenia has already come. You guys are all figments of my imagination. Anyway. Now one of my goals though, you know, I love catfish and they live a long time.

[04:56:28] They get really damn big. If you see those guns, I'd love to catch one now and be in my sixties and catch the same fish twice and recognize it. Maybe I'll lift a scar or something. Yeah, that'd be really cool. Going back to the fish thing, you know, cause both the fish has gone through a lot. I've gone through a lot and we can just be like ominous.

[04:56:45] Exactly, exactly. But then I'll die and then I'll die of a heart attack and my mammoths will leave me. That's something I look forward to. Uh, Charles, this is one of the most amazing conversations I've ever had. It's truly an honor that, uh, that you would, uh, spend your valuable time with me. And I'm glad you exist in the cryptocurrency and the technology space.

[04:57:04] And I could see your love for mathematics and your love for life. Just radiate through everything you do. So thank you for being you. And thank you for talking to me today is a lot of fun. Thank you so much. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Charles Hoskinson and thank you to gala games, all form, indeed expressly, PN, and a sleep.

[04:57:25] Check them out in a description to support this podcast. And now let me leave you with some words from William Faulkner. You cannot swim for new horizons until you have the courage to sight of the shore. Thank you for listening. I hope to see you next time.

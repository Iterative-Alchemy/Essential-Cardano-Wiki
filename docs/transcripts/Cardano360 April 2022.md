# Cardano360 April 2022

[00:00:00] Welcome to your April edition of Cardone 360, your monthly catch up with the people and projects building out this incredible Cardona ecosystem. Now, before we begin, make sure to like subscribe and hit that bell icon for all the latest Cardona content and news from the team here at. Now it's a bit of a development specialist month with updates on Marlo Cardona's domain specific language for financial smart contracts.

[00:00:39] We'll also be looking at side chains and how they are opening up opportunities and options for developers looking to build on current. Plus we'll be getting an update from Sunday, swap and August two projects currently building on Guardado with a deeper dive into what the model is bringing to the party.

[00:00:57] John, Kevin and Nigel will be along later for a technical development update, but to kick things off, I caught up with David Taylor, global marketing director, the Cardona foundation for a quick update.

[00:01:10] So David, welcome back to Cardona 360, been a busy time for you recently, the Cardona foundation with a number of new initiatives and quite a lot of hiring. It has indeed. Tim, thanks very much for having me back. It's always a pleasure. As you said, it's been a busy time. We've been working with the university of Zurich.

[00:01:26] We're sponsoring some students through our scholarship program for their summer school. We're also working on a research program. So there's plenty more to come in that in the near future. On the hiring front, we've hired a plethora of community managers. We've got five marketing roles that are open. So please go and visit our careers page on Cod Arno foundation, website, and last but not least, we've recently appointed a condo who is an source veteran, driving the governance future of cars.

[00:01:57] We've also got our friends are very tree who have also been very busy behind the scenes. They have now planted a verified over 500,000 trees on the Cardona and blockchain and David, it's not going to get any quieter over the summer. Is it? Uh, I believe we can now talk about what we're going to do at consents.

[00:02:14] We can indeed it, and it's certainly not going to get any quieter anytime soon. In fact, it's ramping up. One of the things that I'm proud to be able to talk about is our participation at consensus. We've got a 50 foot by 20 foot booth cardamom foundation, IO and partners are going to be there and we're going to be showcasing the wonderful platform that is called Arno, as well as all of those that are building on the Cardona platform.

[00:02:40] But that's. Everything. We're having an exciting community event the night before the main event. So we'll be sure to share details on that as to how people can sign up for that. So that community event, of course, is on the 8th of June before the main event, which was from the ninth to the 12th of June.

[00:02:56] It's also worth mentioning, we'll have a developer event on the 13th. So if you're a developer building on Cardona or wanting to build a car down, keep an eye on IGS, community discord for developers for more news on that soon, we'll have a link at the bottom. So David obviously still a lot going on behind the scenes, in the preparation and planning for the event.

[00:03:14] But perhaps you can give us a glimpse of what people can expect at consents. Absolutely Tim. And one of the things that we'll be talking about is the fact that Caetano is open for business. We're not just talking about sustainability from an eco point of view, but we're talking about sustainability of the platform.

[00:03:30] So we'll be showcasing a breadth of partners from across the ecosystem. Those that are building Cardona and those that are building Ancar Dano to eliminate any ghosts that may be out there. So David great news. We'll obviously share more details on that as it comes, but people can meanwhile, sign up to attend the community event.

[00:03:48] What do they need to do? They can indeed, we're going to make it super simple. Tim, we have an event Brite page that will go live shortly and people can sign up for that. So I encourage them to sign up, come along and get to meet them. So that's the eighth to the 13th. If you want dates for your diaries, if you can attend in person.

[00:04:06] But of course we'll be bringing you lots of content from there. So you can follow along on social media as well. David, thanks very much for joining us. Thanks Tim. See you in the lone star state. So be sure to follow along with IMGs and the CF social channels for more updates on the road to consensus and how you can join us either in Austin or virtually for the community event on the 8th of June.

[00:04:28] And of course the developer workshop bookending consensus, you'll find some links below. As well as their value in adding scaling capability side chains are central to car darnos interoperability strategy Plutus is a powerful, smart contract language, utilizing the many benefits of the EUT XO model to create innovative new native defy and Dex propositions with features you just can't build on traditional account-based.

[00:04:56] And we have a growing number of native projects already live on the chain. Many of which were featured on the show and many more to come once the June vessel hard fork enhancements have been implemented, but of course there's a whole world of account-based models out there and solidity developers looking to take advantage of some of darnos core capabilities this month.

[00:05:17] Morgan, our head of ecosystem growth met up with three projects looking to bring these new users and developers to cut down on.

[00:05:28] Hi everyone. I'm Morgan Scofield, head of ecosystem growth for IOG today. I'm excited to be hosting some projects that are scaling on the Klarna ecosystem. I'll be joined by MILCOM Mudder and one chain and featuring a update from our EVM side chain. Sebastian understanding the accommodator is in the home stretch of launching a public beta of their side chain.

[00:05:53] Can you give us an update on what the community can expect this year? So milk I'm going to have launched a few weeks ago on car Donald main net. The first version on Cardona main net has limited functionality, which is to say, you can bridge your ADA to milk ADA, which is the common asset. We have support for some people.

[00:06:12] For example, we have support for world mobile token and we have support for USCC UACT. Um, but this, this process of adding new tokens is process of bridging tokens. It's not a hundred percent the experience we want, but we have kind of this beta. The other thing is that we currently don't support bridging NFTs, but we do have a counter proposal to add that functionality.

[00:06:33] So this is the current state that. Uh, but we've seen good adoption with that. We've had so far with the catalyst proposal in progress. Could you give us an update on what the community can expect coming later this year? So the first version of milk economy that we've released is what's called a site chain.

[00:06:49] However, in the future, we want to move to a layer, two solution, which for those that don't know, it means that the security of mil Camano will leverage the security of Cardinal. So you don't have to have any additional trust assumptions when you see them, we'll come to. So this is something that we've been researching and working on, and that we'll continue to make progress this year.

[00:07:10] I'm not sure if we'll be able to get the full deployment this year. Um, but we definitely make a lot of progress on the implementation. Additionally, we're also going to be contributing more to the protocol itself to help build out the core developer ecosystem. So that comes to, for example, core functionality, like the NFT bridge that will be working.

[00:07:29] But also comes through deployments of protocols to Malcolm comrades. So for example, calc proposal template, diagnosis safe. And we also have a proposal for a deployment of the graph for people who want to write indexer protocols. So we have quite a few protocols that we plant. Either develop ourselves to a run on milk Contra or that we have partners that we're working with development.

[00:07:51] And we'll kind of a, we'll hope to have a kind of a rich first year, uh, full of, of per call is being deployed to cardamom through mail coming up. And can you tell us a little bit more about how the experience has been? So, so our team has been involved in car Dano for many years, so we've had a lot of experience building.

[00:08:08] SDKs and, uh, building out the car down ecosystem with IOT and other partners. So we're taking the years of experience we have and, you know, using that to contribute to Cardon itself and help, um, other projects we want to build on Cardinal note, take advantage of these tools. Notably, we're really interested in the vassal Hartford, because it adds a lot of features that specifically make it easier to write Pluto smart contracts in general.

[00:08:32] Let's do again a little bit more about that vessel hall. I'm sure the community is curious. What changes do you see coming later this year? There's two key features that we care about. One is called data inputs, and the other one is called inline data. So notice that both these have to do with data. And that's because of what I mentioned earlier about data availability.

[00:08:53] Basically we want to take the states of the military. And put that state onto Cordova and to do that, we need to make sure that the data we make available on the Cardinal blockchain and be consumed by Plutus smart contracts. And it can also be seen by other people. Um, our sinking in the current on blockchain inline data allow us to make the data available directly to people without having them know the internal state of

[00:09:20] And once you have the DNM, you can consume the data from other validators scripts. So this is great. If you want to do stuff like challenge periods, or any kind of system like that, this data input system, plus the combination of inline data must make this step possible. So, Sebastian, you mentioned that milk comedy will offer a bridge from Catano to other blocks.

[00:09:40] Can you tell us a little bit more about that? So one of the reasons that we built mill Camira is that it allows for compatibility with a lot of the other crypto ecosystem. So Cardinal has its own unique way of working, which is called the so model, which is very different from Ethereum and a lot of Ethereum based blockchains.

[00:09:58] So Malcolm and it had this kind of compatibility layer that helps Cardona communicate with other chains. And we've been working with bridge partners, such as nomad, which have allowed us to break. If they're in. To Carvana and natively. So now you can trade them a part around Texas. And also thanks to this.

[00:10:14] We can also bridge the other way around as well. So tokens who are on Cordato, who want to have their token available on other chains that says Ethereum. So it's just avalanche and more, uh, it can basically, uh, request them they'll come in and validate. To have their token bridged from and then we can work with bridge partners to get those tokens available across multiple blockchains.

[00:10:37] Interoperability has always been one of the key pillars of the Cardon project. So it's great that we at DC spark and at milk, I have been able to push towards that and I look forward to an exciting future together. Thank you so much, Sebastian. There's been tons of support for Mount kilometer in the community, and we're really looking forward to what comes next.

[00:10:58] Earlier this week, one chain caught the community's attention by announcing they're building a bridge, connecting Catano to other blockchains. Today we're joined by Dr. Zhang of the one chain team. Dr. Jang, what are your criteria when selecting blockchains to commit? Oh, yes. Thank you. Morgan is going to be in this Caetano 360 event when we choose a blockchain to connect with.

[00:11:21] Uh, we, of course, we look at the influence of those block chains and we also look at the technical merit of the block chains and has been in our top list, uh, because Caetano is, uh, proofs. POS based with the advantage of high scalability, those transaction fees, and also of course, uh, uh, high energy efficiency.

[00:11:44] Uh, but we could not connect to, uh, Caetano at that time because CodeNow this very differently. They use a HESCO and use puto, and also there are some differences with signature scheme as well. We fortunately were able to, to solve this problem, uh, with, uh, Caetano side chain strategy and initiative. Yeah.

[00:12:05] And then I think once we connect with Caetano where I can bring value to Caetano ecosystem by allowing assets in other proteins to be transferred, to Caetano, to be used by Caetano applications and also that, uh, Catan or asset to be transferred to other blockchains and be used by other, uh, blockchain applications.

[00:12:26] I'm sorry. So what would one chain bring to the Caetano ecosystem? Yeah. And that's, uh, that's when this method is we, these, you are going to see that, uh, Caetano asset and application will be interoperable with other blockchains that's. Just mentioned that the ADA asset can be transferred to one chain.

[00:12:47] Blockchain can be transferred to ECU and blockchain and use by, uh, other blockchain applications, such as a fabrication can use a rep ETA and then the other assets can be transferred. Caetano as well. And Catana was ecosystem can use the assets from other portions, such as ether can use in Cassandra blockchain and that's for the fungible tokens.

[00:13:12] And then you can also do lump function for tokens. That means the end-up T tokens can be transferred. Uh, from other blockchain to and transfer how as well. So you're going to see her kind of Crow, chant, application, field across different blockchains and particularly the, uh, waste cut on the block chain.

[00:13:32] So what are the biggest hurdles that you encountered when building this. There are multiple hurdles. The first there's a program in language hurdle, you use Pluto and Haskell what UBM uses is EBM. And so they did he, and they said, hold off a transactional model, UTX versus account based. And the biggest one that when you asked this question is led to the cryptography.

[00:13:56] Uh, support is different. Uh, uh, Caetano actually support the TSA and the code 2 5, 5 1 9, uh, changing. Cryptography is difficult because this needs change in the core layer. So you need a hard fork. Fortunately, we get great support from Catano team. They actually implement, uh, uh, the support for scenarios in nature.

[00:14:20] And also SECP 2 56 K one, which will be in June hard fork. So we'd really appreciate that. And we think that this will greatly improve the interoperability of . Could you tell us more about the asset transfer? Yeah. Um, asset transfer. Normally you have a soul chain, you have a target chain, and then you have some breach note that will watch the transaction in the soar chain.

[00:14:48] And once you see a CRO chain asset request, uh, you actually locked the asset in the soft chain and. The the same amount of assets on the target chain. And this is easy to say, but you need to make sure that the locking is secure. The transfer is secure. There is no collusion of the breach note, and you also need to embrace through that.

[00:15:11] Both salt chain and touch chain are secure. So any hack in the or the breach will cause a big damage to the asset transfer. Well, and you mentioned earlier about the security. How are you looking to improve security? Yeah, that's a, that's a great question. As you, you have heard that there have been many police hacks recently with headache.

[00:15:37] Probably supposed to saying that his pessimist is mistake about cold chain transactions, because breaches are not secure. Uh, we, we take his posts very seriously. So with solution, we're actually building a two phase, uh, mocha three pool for. To the questions, transactions, basically all the salt chain block and the transactions will be vocalized.

[00:16:05] And then the local tree dude will be saved to the Catan or block chain so that we can make sure that this the transaction in the solution is secure, not just in the soul chain, but also can be secured and verified in the target chain, in the, or chain as well. So, Possible only apt to cut down or had the snow signature and also add the SECP 2 56 K one through the

[00:16:34] Dr. Dan, thank you so much for joining us on this. Month's Caetano 360. Thank you, Morgan. Great to talk to you. Thanks again, Dr. Jang for joining us today, the one chain team have guest authored a blog post on the IHK site. Be sure to check that out, linked in the description below. I know you may have heard rumblings in the community about interoperability solutions.

[00:17:01] And today we welcome Catherine Stacey to the show. Katherine is a product marketer for all side chains, projects, and she's here to give us a brief update on the ongoing work for EVM side chain. Katherine welcome to the show. Thanks so much for the fantastic introduction, Morgan, and I'm very excited to be here to discuss this project with the community.

[00:17:21] As I hear, many people are very eager to learn more about it. So little fun fact is that side chains are not actually a new idea to IHK. And in fact, two papers were published back in 2017 by the company. One about proof of work side chains, and one about proof of stake site. If anyone would like to read these research papers, you can head on over to I O H k.com locate the research tab.

[00:17:50] And then when you get to that page in the search box, just type inside chains and a couple of different research papers will pop up. What the side chains mean for the ketonic community? The EVM side chain is actually a continuation of this initiative that has to bring greater programmability, interoperability, and scalability to the Cartano network.

[00:18:14] The EVM side chain in particular, of course, adds in new EDM and web three capabilities, making it very easy for solidity developers to bring their existing decentralized applications. From EBM networks to deploy them on Cardona, which is something I know everyone is very eager to see happen. So people may be wondering why a side chains needed to do this.

[00:18:38] And what's stopping us from doing this on the core network. No, that's a fantastic question, Morgan. We could add EPM and web. Capabilities to the core network. The one issue there is that when you introduce additional features to the network, you then make the core code more complex, and that could potentially introduce new attack factors.

[00:19:05] So side chains are one of the most secure ways that you can add new features to a network without potentially introducing unnecessary security risks, alphabet. When will this be ready? So the development of side chains, just like many other products has a natural development cycle that it needs to go through in order to achieve completion.

[00:19:29] The first stage along our developmental journey is what is known as the standalone test net. And during this phase, solidity developers will be able to connect their EDM applications to the Testnet using RPC methods. I'm all stage one is really fun and exploratory during phase two is where things start to get really exciting.

[00:19:51] This is what is going to be known as our passive side chain stage. This is a phase where we connect the bridge so that the node will be able to read the state from the Cartano Testnet and adapt accordingly. Now, if you thought stage two was exciting, you better Fasten your seatbelts for what comes.

[00:20:09] Stage three is what is known as the active side chain stage. And during this stage, we will have a full, active side chain there's able to observe and to take action on the Cardona. Testnet then we will have the main net deployment phase. After we have an active side chain up and running, we will then go through our final phases of test and code optimizations.

[00:20:34] We will then deploy it to the Cardona. Now, I know I just talked around these points of the side chains journey without ever giving you a date, Morgan, but don't worry. This is intended and it's all part of my master plan to keep the community coming back for more. Thank you so much for having me on the show today, Morgan.

[00:20:54] It was a pleasure to get to talk to the community about this project. Thank you to all of our guests for joining me today. You can check them out on Twitter. We've linked their handles. For more information on side chains, bridges, and our interoperability solutions. Check out our latest blog post also in the description below.

[00:21:14] So exciting things on the way, and we'll be sure to bring you more news and dates over the weeks and months ahead. Meanwhile, be sure to check out the blog link below. Marlo is car darnos low-code solution built with the goal of making financial, smart contract development, accessible to everyone today, we're announcing our latest pioneer program to step things up again, let's go to Dominica to find out more.

[00:21:42] Hi everyone. My name is Dominico and I am working here at IOG as a marketing and communications manager, supporting a number of projects, including the Marlow pioneer program, which we're going to talk about today. So for those who are not familiar with what Marlo is, it is a domain specific language Knight for creating financial, smart contracts and a suite of products designed for.

[00:22:08] Executing those financial smart contracts on the blockchain. And today I am joined by Omer Husain, who is the product manager for my. And Omar is going to share with us some exciting updates on the Marlo pioneer program. Hi Omer. Thanks for joining me today for this special update. Now I know if in working closely together recently to bring this program to life, however, our viewers, uh, can you tell us a bit more about the recent updates that were made to Marlo and what is the Marlow pioneer program, how it works and who is it?

[00:22:46] Um, Marlo is DSL and Sweden of products creates a blockchain specific way to replicate key financial processes by making it really easy to design and implement smart contracts. So we're positioning Marlo is something that allows for the easy transfer of best practices and principles across the spaces of defy and tried fire to create an eventual impact real.

[00:23:08] Which seemingly operate in parallel worlds at the moment. So not only will we be integrating different parts of Cardona together, but we're also providing an easy, efficient, and local solution to allow the pioneers to showcase real world use. That way, the creators on Marto, um, whether you're adapt developer, a financial engineer or a non-technical expert can focus on their business, logic and policies while imagining and building out their smart contract applications.

[00:23:37] Um, reducing the burden of actually building the smart contract. So the Marlo pioneer program is for these folks. It's to get the creators more acquainted with Marlo and inspire and kick off a host of projects in the open source world. We want to build a rich and diverse ecosystem of users who can benefit from simplicity and power of Marlo steal.

[00:23:57] I'm wondering if we can speak a little bit more about the program curriculum and what the participants should expect to learn? Sure. It's going to last approximately eight weeks and the pioneers can basically expect to learn a basic overview of, of Marlow, um, go in depth on how it's designed and embedded in Haskell and JavaScript.

[00:24:19] Um, we're going to talk a little bit. Standardization and how we use standards in Marlow, how assurances in certain conveniences can be provided within the system. And also a little bit about the command line tools that we've just published a blog about. And lastly, we're also going to talk about how, uh, you can apply Marlo to design certain use-case.

[00:24:41] It seems like Marlo team has made an incredible progress in the recent months. And recently we have shared two blogs about updates to Marlo, playground and introduction to command line interface tool. Do you want to share a little bit more about those updates? It's just a lot easier for the Bioneers to use the Marlow playground.

[00:25:03] We've improved the UX and added some basic new functionalities. Along with that, there's a blog that has been published about the CLI tool. And I would really recommend you to go read that. And the CLI tool will basically be used in the program to depths the Marlo contracts. I'd also like to point out there's going to be a new blog coming up on the adoption approach with Marlo and how we see the financial innovation landscape of.

[00:25:28] It's all sounds really great. Thank you so much, AMR. It was great chatting with you and for anyone interested in joining the first cohort of the Marlo pioneer program, we encourage you to check the registration link in the description of the video. Thanks so much for joining. Thanks so much for having me.

[00:25:50] Now, if you're interested in becoming a model, a pioneer, you'll find the links below.

[00:25:57] Hi everyone. My name is Daniel rebar and I'm one of the members of the community team here at IO for project catalyst. And we're super excited today to have this opportunity to share with you some of the great recent happenings with project catalyst and update you with. Overall progress. And, you know, project athletes has found really tremendous success in empowering people to explore their ideas and connecting them to a source of funding so they can actually realize them.

[00:26:25] But the further than that, it also really facilitates projects that are designed to support this. Early start entrepreneurs. So without further ado, I'll pass you over to Tim Richmond, who is our marketing and communications lead and has an update for us on the recent successes of project catalyst based incubators and mentorship programs.

[00:26:46] Hi everybody. I'm Tim Richmond. I'm the marketing communications lead for project catalyst. And I'm really happy to report that the accelerators and mentorship programs that are taking part on project catalyst are growing in number three major success stories that we've had recently. Um, the first of which is the boost camp mentorship program, which is essentially.

[00:27:09] Program of workshops designed to help early start entrepreneurs to formalize their business plans. Uh, five cohorts have already taken place. Uh, most of which have, uh, been consisting of a target and Plutus pioneers and teams funded by project catalyst. I'm also happy to report the launch of the erode program in collaboration with a pan African incubator and accelerator.

[00:27:37] Aerobic aims to make real world changes in Africa by facilitating relationships between projects, working on car dyno and the wider African war. There've been nine projects, which have started with arable ready. And so we'll be following their progress as time continues in more great news on this subject, we're really excited to announce a fantastic collaboration between.

[00:28:03] Project catalyst seed stars and the financial times to launch the Ft. Cartano blockchain challenge. Wow. Well, this sounds like a great collaboration. We all know the financial times needs no introduction, but could you let the community know who the seed stars are? The sea stars are a Swiss based venture builder, whose mission is to impact people's lives in emerging markets by leveraging.

[00:28:28] Technology and entrepreneurial seats, stars are looking for ventures who are building on car dyno or interested in leveraging the car dyno platform and community, the Ft car dyno blockchain challenge. We'll select startups for a three-day bootcamp and shortlisted entrepreneurs will then go on to a further accelerator program applications for this are open until the 31st of May.

[00:28:52] So if you are interested in taking part or you want to learn more than Google. Seed stars, Ft, current Arnaud, blockchain challenge. And with that back to you, Danny, uh, I believe you have an update for us on the D reps. Yes. Thanks Tim. So we're approaching the future of governance to project catalyst, and we're doing it by introducing the concept of delegating your voting power to a delegate representative or the reps for short.

[00:29:21] And these, the reps will really. Within a liquid democratic framework, we've recently published a blog post. So I invite you to go and check it out, but essentially ADA holders can select one or multiple directs to harness their voting power on fund to fund basis. And given the tremendous growth in the number of proposals being submitted, the reps will be very instrumental and important part of the machinery in industry.

[00:29:48] That all of the proposals get the attention. They really deserve just in fund eight. We are now with more than 1000 proposals. So this will be very much welcomed and it will really enhance the quality of decision-making within each fund. And the idea is that these deer abs the cohort of these deer apps will coordinate and form policies together source and review data consult with experts and ultimately really vote on.

[00:30:17] Array of projects and topics that really the community has brought forward. And we're going to make sure to continue sharing more details on the reps as the concept crystallizes over coming weeks and months. And obviously as more and more proposals are submitted, there needs to be a way to be able to manage them.

[00:30:37] So it's great to hear that that's in the works. Can we let the community know where we're at in terms of project catalyst? Everything that is happening in the catalyst community. And that, that transpires into the wider Cardona community is really a great Testament to the passion and commitment that everybody collectively shows.

[00:30:55] And that really personally excites me. I mean, we've seen the project catalyst grown from an initial fund size of about quarter million dollars. Some 18 months ago, two 16 million around currently active in fund eight. And that's just phenomenal, you know, receiving over three and a half thousand proposals.

[00:31:15] Or ideas and collectively achieving really a staggering 1 million votes being in those previous rounds. So it's really a, a true Testament to people's eagerness to actually participate and shape the future of the governance, uh, in the project catalyst realm and this project, they really cover a wide range of community set challenges that are all really focused on utilizing.

[00:31:40] The on of blockchain that we all come to love to make positive, real world changes. And who's at the heart of it. Well, you meet everyone. The community, you know, there's currently 52,000 members on ideas, scale innovation platform that is at the center of project catalyst, and that is tapping into nine.

[00:32:00] One countries across the world, which is just a staggering number to think about the potential of collaboration of all these people coming together. And it all continues to grow. So we're really excited and extremely proud of what the community has created. And we really want to thank each and every member for all the contributions they have made because surely catalyst is not an easy thing.

[00:32:22] It is still an experiment. Things do often break and we appreciate the patience and willingness to work with us collectively, as we navigate the project catalyst fund to fund. Thank you, Danny. For that update, that's really great to hear, and we're always interested in getting new people involved. Can you let us know the best way that the community can grow and people can get involved in that.

[00:32:45] Yes, absolutely. You know, as the fund we grow, we always have room for more people to join and it just brings the diversity and the knowledge base to a much wider spectrum of people who are participating. One of the really the easiest ways is to dial into our Wednesday calls. Uh, we call them town halls and they're each Wednesday at 5:00 PM UTC.

[00:33:05] And if you can't make this time slot that's okay. All these calls are being recorded and stream to YouTube directly. So you can always review them later, but also there are. Community calls around the globe in different time zones and different places, such as Eastern Townhall, Latin American African. So there's plenty of opportunities for you to get involved, even though if this main time slot doesn't work for you, but you will always find us there at 5:00 PM.

[00:33:30] UTC on Wednesdays. I would just like to remind the community that we are in the middle of the fund eight vote. So don't forget to exercise your voice and vote using the voter. That's it for the update today. Thanks for watching. See you next time now in April's mid month update, we spoke in detail about the vessel hard fork on track for the end of June and what those enhancements would mean for Cardone.

[00:33:54] Let's go over to John, Kevin and Nigel for catch-up.

[00:34:01] Gentlemen welcome. Now, John, you gave us a pretty meaty update in the mid month, but perhaps you can give us a little bit of a recap of some of the things you shared. Sure, absolutely. Tim. Well, I had this feeling that there wasn't a place where a person could go to get a condensed, concise view on Plutus as it stands right now.

[00:34:19] What I wanted to do was shoot a quick video, which I did with the help of your team to put together in a kind of visual way with simple explanation. Our real zero to hero for Plutus. And what I tried to do was sit down and explain the context, explain what Plutus lets you do. Like what are the things that enables, I also showed exactly how you go from writing code to getting something that's working on chain.

[00:34:41] And I talked about how you interact with that once it's on chain and I guess maybe different to some of the other materials we have online. I started looking as well, not just at the present, but into the future as to what we're delivering for the Hartford. So the video is available and I think it's a nice introduction, um, both at an intermediate and a beginner level, uh, to exactly what Plutus is.

[00:35:01] And like I said, I really pitched it as a zero to hero. So you can go in, you may know some of the stuff, but I think there's something there that, that folks can get something out of. So we've got that as a standalone video now as well. So people should go and have a look at that to find the full story.

[00:35:14] Kevin, we also talked about the network. How does. Oh, it's looking great. The network is coping extremely well with everything we're throwing out at all of the core stats are looking good and a real call out to all the state pool operators, trend groups take a lot operators who are keeping things up and running for us.

[00:35:32] What ongoings. So at the moment we've got about 73% of the pools. Uh, 1 34 0.1. Most of the restaurant wants 33.0. And looking ahead, we will soon be rolling out 1 35 within the next few weeks. Keep an eye open for that. That's going to have a number of improvements included. It's also going to start to pave the way towards the vassal hard fork.

[00:35:57] So all of these. On that one thing we've done earlier this week, as you've probably noticed is we've just pushed, uh, the latest parameter bump. John is going to be extremely pleased. We've gone up by another 10%, John, uh, from 80 kilobytes to 88 kilobytes. Great, great stuff. There more cost to going into the network, more abilities, run Plutus scripts, more ability to run impressive small transactions.

[00:36:22] And looking ahead, we'll also be looking into adjusting some of the economic parameters. We've been listening to community, taking some input from them, taking some feedback from them. So stay tuned. We'll make an announcement on those soon. Uh, Nigel, we also shared the target date for the vassal hard fork of the 29th of June.

[00:36:44] What's, uh, what's happening now behind the scenes to get us ready for that. Well, so I've worked him as usual. So for the target date of 29th of June, we're making a lot of great progress. And as we've said before, we are coach Blake, but we're going through a phase now of integration across all the different code bases we've got on the products that we have as we go through this integration phase, we'll then move into our tests.

[00:37:04] So it is all hands to the pump and there's a lot of work that's going on. And this goes across the full gamuts of our community as well. So the exchanges are all lined up to do the testing we've got. And this time we've had the ability to enlist a couple of partner projects to help us do end, to end testing with their adapts.

[00:37:24] And that's just incredibly useful because the first thing is it helps us to do regression testing to make sure they can still do everything. And then they could do. We changed the code base and it also enables them to look at some of the future changes and think about how they can utilize those changes to improve their adapts going forward.

[00:37:43] And then from there to be able to build the test cases, we need to be able to, to deliver against that functionality. So all guns blazing effectively, Tim, or, um, yeah. And of course, the end of June, the vassal hard fork, it's the first step in a process. Isn't it? John, there is a period of bedding in that will need to happen straight after the hard-fought from both a developer perspective, but also from a network perspective.

[00:38:07] Absolutely. So it's going to take exactly one epoch for the changes that we put in, in the hard fork. This is for various technical reasons with dependencies in terms of rolling over a single epoch. So we're making the change on the Eve of the poppy rollover, and we can't make the enablement of those changes until the next epoch, but it's, it's, it's a single week.

[00:38:25] And, uh, it's, it's, we, we knew this was going to be the case from the beginning, but what folks need to be doing is actually learning how to take advantage of these things. So let me just quickly kind of run through them, reference scripts, this idea that your script lives on chain rather than being submitted in the trends.

[00:38:39] You're going to have to change the architecture of your app, if you want to take advantage of this. So no longer including the script and the transaction, and instead, including a reference. So you can point to it on chain. Let's look in line datums. Again, this is something where we're moving things onto the chain.

[00:38:53] So now your, your data, which is like your hard disk for your app, and I don't mean to overly simplify it, but it's arbitrary data that lives on chain, uh, can be high scores or other data that's important to your app that can live now on chain, on its own, rather than it being included in the trends. Prior to this, it was a fingerprint that lived on chain.

[00:39:10] So again, you have to make sure that you start forming transactions where you no longer include the data, which is against smaller transactions. This is great, but it's not enabled by default developers have to embrace these new features. And then finally reference inputs again, maybe quite subtle. This one, the idea that multiple apps and indeed multiple entities can read a UTX of value without having to destroy it and recruit.

[00:39:33] Again, folks are going to need to change potentially aspects of their architecture in order to take advantage of this. These are things that are, I think, relatively straightforward to understand, but will require app developers to actively take advantage of them. So between getting these new features on chain and having them actually switched on developers, reach out, work with us, go to the stock exchange network, look at our documentation and learn exactly how to take advantage of these things so that they're ready.

[00:39:56] And of course, we're going to have our test net available. So developers want to play with this stuff early. Please do get in there. Thank you, John, staying with you just for now. We've obviously talked about the Plutus enhancements. We've talked about diffusion pipelining. One of the other topics that we've covered in the past is around input endorses.

[00:40:12] What is the latest. One of the most exciting parts about my job is that I get to work on the right now, all the cool stuff coming up in June. But I also get a glimpse into the future, of course, because I have to work with the rest of the smart people at IO to architect it. So about two weeks ago, I spent a week with the research team and these are the big brains.

[00:40:30] These folks, they, they think of, uh, design, uh, the high level approach to new tech. I've spoken before, but input endorsers input endorsers is the name of a technology it's going to be branded externally. I suspect that's or Boris layoffs. That's how we're, we're kind of going to envisage it. Um, we currently have coral Boris Prayas and or aboard layoffs will be the next generation at consensus mechanism.

[00:40:53] So input endorsers is the internal name for this. And what is it? Research after a long time, kind of thinking about things have come up with a solution. And the key insight here is if we want to scale Cardona over the next decade, if we want to make things super fast, we need to make a serious change. So what we're going to do is at the moment we have a single type of block on the credential network.

[00:41:15] It's a block that is responsible for consensus, and it also holds inside of transactions. The key realization that that research had was if we decompose this or we split the block into two, so no longer having a single block in the network, but we now have two blocks and we'll use one block to hold transactions and another block to achieve consensus.

[00:41:37] Then we have these two block types that work together. And what's great. Here is at the moment our single block is every 20 seconds. So every 20 seconds or so we have a block that contains transactions and helps with. We're moving to a new system with our force LALS or input endorsers, where we will still have this consensus book every 20 seconds.

[00:41:57] But instead of contending transactions, it will no longer do that. It will. Have a reference to a block that holds transactions, but these blocks are much, much faster. So we're going to be constantly streaming transactions nonstop. Okay. There's going to be a flurry of these blocks that contain just transactions and the blocks that are responsible for consensus will simply refer.

[00:42:19] Using what's called reference semantics or a pointer. So with this new system effectively, we can have consensus every 20 seconds as we currently do, but rather than waiting every 20 seconds to send transactions, we're going to send them all the time. And this ultimately yields a super fat layer one. Now we don't need this right now.

[00:42:39] Our current technologies are keeping up with demand, no problem, but we need to stay ahead of the game. And how do we do that? We think for the future, and we start implementing this stuff before. So this stuff is new research. You're finalizing over the coming, been a few weeks and then engineering and architecture will be taking over and towards Q3.

[00:42:58] We'll be formalizing our engineering strategy. So watch this space. Uh, there's very exciting things coming, John. Thank you very much, Kevin Nigel, we'll see you again soon. Every month, we profile a selection of projects that are building on Cardona for today's episode. We thought we do things a little differently.

[00:43:16] So we asked Matt to catch up with Sunday, swap and Orbis to talk about Cardona's extended UT model and how it's empowering defy projects across the ecosystem.

[00:43:30] This week, I got the chance to speak with a couple of projects about building defy applications with the UTX on model, the challenges, the benefits, and what you can expect as a builder on Cardona. We spoke with Brian Orbis and PI of Sunday. Swap, welcome pie. Good to have you on the show. So Sunday was one of the first teams to launch a Dex on Cordato a few months.

[00:43:53] Can you give us an update on what's been happening at Sunday since launch, we were one of the first Dexis, certainly first AMM based decks to launch on Cartano. Um, just passed our one year kind of anniversary as a team. And, um, we've launched our protocol in January. Um, we served kind of a critical role of proving that defy would possible on Cartano to kind of some of the skeptics out there.

[00:44:18] Um, and since then we've been kind of heads down, focusing on. Um, keeping the lights running and building out, um, kind of some V2 and some very exciting kind of future developments for the Sunday protocol. So what is the model? And can you explain a defy application as an instantiation of that model on the Cardona blockchain?

[00:44:36] So is an accounting model, uh, how you keep track of balances and state in comparison to something like an account model used over. Um, EUT XO stands for extended unspent transaction output, which means that all of the state is stored as outputs of a previous transaction. So on a theory, them, every smart contract is given kind of this big black slate of memory to store values in, um, kind of like a clay tablet that you can, you know, chisel values into.

[00:45:08] Whereas on an model, all of that state is kind of store. Um, in much smaller pellets alongside kind of the coins that are moving around in the system. Um, so an example of how this might be instantiated is on, uh, an EUT TXO model. Um, the liquidity might be stored in one output at each user's order of, you know, whether they want to.

[00:45:33] Uh, ADA for LQ and how much they want to swap for it. And their limit price is stored in a separate output. And then you can build a transaction that executes that order by including those two things in the transaction without having to include. Um, the whole big clay tablet of everybody's orders. So a lot of the industry wisdom and experience on Dex building has been on account-based chains in the history of cryptocurrency.

[00:45:59] Uh, and yet you guys are pioneers in the space of defy on UTX. So can you tell us what are some of the trade-offs the costs and benefits that you've experienced as a building out Sunday and also what you expect as development continues? Certainly the biggest challenge so far has been this mindset. From a global state that big clay tablet, like on Ethereum to a local state, right?

[00:46:25] A Dex is something that fundamentally has a lot of global state to it, the order of people's orders and the price of an asset. Um, so that mindset shift to compartmentalizing that state and brokering access to global state has been really difficult, um, on the flip side, because that state is already broken up Charlotte.

[00:46:46] That state into different chains and looking at layer twos is a far easier problem. Um, so whereas on a theory from, uh, you have no way to know what parts of that clay tablet, the smart contract is can access because the state is already compartmentalized in Cartano, um, or in the exo model, uh, that becomes far easier.

[00:47:06] So while I'm not ready to announce anything in particular that should give you kind of a flavor of some of the things that we've been thinking about behind the. For a Sunday swap V2. Thank you PI for your insight about building D five projects on UTX. So I think the community really values your perspective.

[00:47:23] So Ryan, over to you, you were recently on the show talking about a DFI project, our Donna, um, but you're also the founder of a scaling solution. I'm guessing that relationship, isn't a mistake. Uh, can you tell us a little bit about Orbis and how it was. Yeah. So all this is a layer to zero knowledge.

[00:47:45] Scaling solution for Cardona utilizing Zika roll-ups and enabling Cardona to scale beyond what the layer one is capable of. So that was conceived through really looking at the whole landscape of blockchain and. The various scaling directions that were explored in different ecosystems and realizing that Cardona was best primed for Zika roll-ups to be leveraged, to help scale the network to a level in which can support a global decentralized financial ecosystem.

[00:48:24] So how does the UK roll-ups work? So starting with zero knowledge proofs, this is a. Area of cryptography. That's actually been around since the 1980s. And it is a way to effectively be able to prove something to someone without revealing that information. It's a. Then roll-ups leverages that technology, that the role of prospect is bundling lots of transactions off chain into a single proof zero-knowledge proof.

[00:48:56] And that zero-knowledge proof is submitted onto Cardone main chain. And it proves that all the transactions happening off chain have happened in a non-malicious way, following the rules of the Cardona ledger. So it's almost. Like you're able to effectively compress, you know, a lot of computational data and transactions and activity off chain into this single proof, uh, which represents all of that on Shane.

[00:49:24] So most work in Zika roll-ups in the past has been on account-based chains. Um, but I'm guessing this isn't just for the likes of Ethereum. Can you tell us a little bit about what an UTX native Zika roll-up solution looks like? Most of the innovation surroundings that are knowledge proofs has been happening in other ecosystems, such as Ethereum, given that defy was spurred that, uh, and came to life much earlier, as opposed to it just really getting started on Cardona.

[00:49:56] So Orbis is one of, if not the first layer, two scaling solutions. Leveraging this and the UTX. So model lends itself more to building roll-up scaling solutions compared to the account-based model and that's to do with the way that it handles state, um, handle state in a local way, as opposed to a global way, um, which makes it a lot easier to parallelize transactions.

[00:50:24] And then to bundle those parallel transactions. Um, well that parallel system into a single purchase to be submitted on Shane. So when people talk about UTX, so they often mention parallelization, uh, local state versus global state. Can you explain what those terms actually mean and what implications they have for, uh, an ecosystem built on the

[00:50:48] So state is effectively how blockchains work they have their state, and then they have state transitions going from one state to another based on inputs and outputs and the transactions or blocks that transition you to the next day. The UTEC. So model handles. In a local way where as opposed to it's referencing the entire system, it's bright down to UTX sows.

[00:51:15] So the private keys that you hold, as opposed to giving you control over global accounts, uh, it gives you control over. Specific UTEC. So each of which can be processed in a parallel way. Now when executing blocks on car dollar. So this makes caught auto, highly paralyzable, and also more amenable to building roll-up solutions as the architecture between roll-ups and the base layer UTX.

[00:51:43] So is, uh, quite uniform. This is important for blockchains and more specifically for Orbis and ZK. Roll-ups given that you're able to handle a lot of work or more specifically transactions at the same time. So parallelism, at least, you know, with regards to Orvis is really leveraging. The UTX. So model on the benefits that provides there, and also extending that to enable us to scale in terms of throughput and how much computation can be handled and all specific points of computation for the transactions can be handled at the same time.

[00:52:23] So it can't all be sunshine and roses. Can you tell us a few of the hurdles that lie on the path to an indefinitely, scalable Cardona? Katana is doing well already. The approach that's taken, um, this methodical approach, uh, has, uh, provided benefits, many of which we'll see in the upcoming Hartford in June as well.

[00:52:43] So this roadmap for 2020 to you going into 2023 with regards to input, endorses, all the various other things that are happening. Already scales the base layer to the extent that it can be scaled. The next challenges are really leveraging the extended scaling solutions, whether that's Orbis, utilizing ZK roll-ups or hydro utilizing its technology there, which is more closely to a state channels approach.

[00:53:11] These are all different tools. The challenges come with different applications, different teams, experimenting with those different tools and combining them and seeing which ones fit their specific needs. And that's a continuous learning process working with the different scaling solutions coming to Kodama.

[00:53:31] Thanks Ryan, for those insights. Uh, thanks everybody for watching. We hope you enjoyed the segment. Come back to us next time for more building on cabana. The Jed stable coin is one of the most anticipated projects currently building on called Donna Coty is building it. And Eric spoke to CEO shaft ball effin to find out the latest status.

[00:53:53] Today we are joined by shutoff bark. Giffin the CEO of Coty. He is here to talk to us about the progress that is being made currently with the Jed stable coin. Welcome to the show. And, uh, what can we expect from Jed? Where are you guys? Thank you for having me here again. It's always a pleasure.

[00:54:10] Everybody's wondering when Jared, so I'm gonna tell everybody, uh, during this update, You know, for those who have missed or lived under a rock recently, Jed is probably the most sophisticated algorithmic stable going out there created to date. We'll also be sharing a video, a whiteboard video, explaining a exactly how it operates or people can just go to jet.xyz and read the full.

[00:54:32] And look as, as Cardinal's defy and overall ecosystem grows, so will jet. So everybody's obviously very excited for Jed to be released. Uh, what are the next steps we've already signed a 25 partnerships to date even before Jedi is launched. So when Jared launches it's like a baby elephant, right? It's already big.

[00:54:50] It's already standing on its own on its own. Uh, eats a lot moves fast. So. A lot in terms of integrations where we at and what to expect next. So in terms of timeline, the private Testnet is already live. We've been fixing the scalability issues. It's now much more scalable and probably in the coming days, we'll see a public Testnet that you can look into and start diving into.

[00:55:17] So what can people expect after the public test net after the public test net? Uh, what we are doing is a rigorous audit. In fact, we're not just doing one security audit, we're doing two, it costs a lot. It takes time, but this is the right way. And probably the only way to go when it comes to, uh, financial tokens, such as jet.

[00:55:37] So we'll do these two, depending on the results. If everything goes well. Public main net jets, official release integration too. I know all the decks is around 25 partnerships as I've met. June, if nothing comes up, this is when we're out in. No, in fact, June and July is, is, is pretty important for Cody as it is, because this is also the time when, on, on Cody's trust chain, native assets can be minted.

[00:56:05] All right. So June and July are going to be big months. How can people get involved? How can they keep up with you guys? Yes, you can help us actually and get involved by testing the public Testnet or. So we've released the code and we invite you to participate in the testing phase by visiting jed.xyz, connecting with your NAMI wallet through the Testnet network.

[00:56:27] Obviously, uh, even beforehand you should, uh, go and get some test ADA at your local ADA. Right. And then you can start minting and burning, uh, Jed and Shen just as a reminder, Jed is the stable coin. Shin is the reserve coin, which you need, uh, when dealing with algorithmic stable coins. And again, you know, there's always room to improve.

[00:56:52] Super important that you get involved, look at it so you can get accustomed to it and trust it because trust is critical when it comes to stable coin. And, you know, Jen does the most sophisticated design out there. It's already been battle tested, you know, as Sigma USD and another network. Uh, but get acquainted with it.

[00:57:13] You know, if you're a part of the Cardinals, uh, ecosystem and community, you're going to have Jed. So get acquainted with it. I invite you to do so through jet.xyz, we heard that you guys have also been working alongside catalyst. What can you tell us about that? Yeah, that's true. Cody is actually opened a fund on top of the catalyst infrastructure.

[00:57:34] We were the first to open this fund and the idea, uh, was, you know, again, thinking about Cody Cardell. Uh, and what can we build together? And as some of you may know, we've created ADP and the pay is a system that allows merchants to accept ADA as a form of payment. Quality has developed that a while back.

[00:57:52] And what we asked projects is can you build us plugins that will allow us to connect. To all, you know, the hundreds of thousands of merchants out there that are using systems like WordPress, Joomla, Shopify, and so on and so forth. We've funded five teams. One is already finished development and they've created a plugin that will allow ADA pay to be connected to WordPress.

[00:58:20] Uh, we've, uh, uh, posted the demo on our blog and we will post an interview with the team sometime soon. And what it means is that, you know, ADP will be present at a lot more merchants in the, uh, sometime soon. And you know, this is adoption as adoption gets so very happy about this Shanghai bar. Gavin, thank you so much for joining us once again on Cardone on 360.

[00:58:45] Thank you for having me here today. Well, that's a wrap for April. Be sure to check out the links below and head over to the IHK blog for the very latest on the CLI interface for Marlow and boosting throughput on Kadana and much more. But before you go a quick update about the future of Cardona 360 now, after doing some research amongst you, the audience and getting your feedback, we've decided to give Cardona three, six.

[00:59:11] A little bit of a spring refresh. Now don't worry. We're not going anywhere, but starting next month, we're going to be releasing standalone videos more regularly alongside our mid month technical updates with the show becoming more of a highlights, reel an omnibus. If you like with some bonus content thrown in from time to time for good measure.

[00:59:30] So there's even more reason to make sure you do the like subscribe and bell thing. So you won't miss a single video. Thanks for watching. And we'll see you.
